Assign Netgen 3D to it and generate a finer mesh.4) Remove 2D elements from the second mesh.5) Remove auxiliary groups with contents (\"Vols\" and \"In Boundary\")6) Fuse the two meshes into one.

You do the following:- Compute the mesh- Rotate the mesh- Modify hypotheses- Compute againWhen you modify hypotheses the elements depending on the changed hypotheses are removed. In this case nodes and elements on edges, faces and solids are removed, but nodes on vertices remain as they do not depend on the 1D hypothesis you modify. At re-computing, nodes on vertices are not re-generated and remain at places they get at rotation, the rest nodes and elements are re-generated and are placed at geometry location (i.e. not rotated).I don't know if it can be considered a bug.RegardsSt.Michael",

When the mesh is computed from scratch or extruded (in the case of 2D OpenFOAM meshing) it can take a very long time just to display the mesh and then to deactivate the volume display.\n\nIt would be very great to be able to deactivate the volume display BEFORE displaying the mesh. Or to deactivate the automatic \"entity display set-up\".\n\nI went through the Salome preferences many times but I didn't find anything about this.\n\nAttached is a very basic study with a (cleared) meshed cube example.

                "Hi,I have posted this question as follow-up of another thread, but maybe I have better chances to get an answer if I open a new one...The general question is: Is it currently possible to create a Salomé module under Windows, and if so, how?More specifically:1. Is there documentation and/or a tutorial on module creation for beginners? Or a sample Windows module that could be taken as starting point?2. I want to add some dialogs, maybe a menu, and call external programs. Can this be done with a Python module which might be easier to build (no C/C++ compiler needed)?3. What would it take to create a module from an existing C++ program (with GUI) under Windows?4. Is there any documentation on the ParaVis module that could teach me how this has been done?5. Is there a way to use existing qt design files for GUI building in a Salomé module?I would appreciate answers to any part of the above...Thanks,Matthias",
                "Hello Matthias,In general, there is no difference on what platform the module is implemented - on Linux or on Windows; the workflow is standard. You thus can follow the procedure described in the SALOME Tutorial.The only difference concerns the build procedure. Existing SALOME Tutorial is based on Linux platform, so the build procedure is described mainly for Linux (cmake, make, make install). On Windows, to build a module, you can use the same approach (from command line), or use the script which comes with SALOME SDK archives (compile.bat, compile.py) - just customize it for your module.1. Is there documentation and/or a tutorial on module creation for \nbeginners? Or a sample Windows module that could be taken as starting \npoint?Refer to SALOME Tutorial.2. I want to add some dialogs, maybe a menu, and call external programs.\n Can this be done with a Python module which might be easier to build \n(no C/C++ compiler needed)?You can use PyQt for this purpose.3. What would it take to create a module from an existing C++ program (with GUI) under Windows?You need to implement a \"wrapper\" around C++ program, following architecture of SALOME platform.4. Is there any documentation on the ParaVis module that could teach me how this has been done?ParaVis module is just a wrapping around the ParaView application (more precisely, its libraries). Unfortunately, there is no good documentation on this module, I can only suggest to learn the source code.5. Is there a way to use existing qt design files for GUI building in a Salomé module?Sure, why no? As SALOME is based on Qt, this can be done easily. Indeed, there is no strict rules about how the GUI should be implemented for a module: you can code dialogs manually from scratch, or create forms in the designer (such approach is, in particular, used in SALOME Geometry module). In Python module, the same can be done with PyQt.I would appreciate answers to any part of the above...Regards,Vadim.",

Either I am doing something wrong, or it just doesn't work that way (ít is said to be tested under Salomé 5).Can such a minimal module still be built that way? If so, how do I activate it?And - is there a Python programmer's tutorial/manual/reference where all available Salomé-specific functions are listed?Thanks,Matthias",

See the enclosed screenshots and the following explanation:First, there are \"bubbles\" in your geometry that I removed (I just created a new shell from all the faces but these ones). See picture 1.Second, you have a face being infinitely thin (picture 2). This cannot be in Salome because you will have infinitely small elements because of this. To delete it and to keep only its \"head\", I partitioned the face beside it (in white wireframe in the picture 3) with the vertex visible in orange (which belongs to the thin face itself and the other face touching it), then after replacing the old face by this partitioned face in a new shell, I could merge both edges of the thin surface with theGlue Facestool (picture 4).Finally, I removed a very thin face on the fuselage and used theSewingtool of Salome to remove the hole.For the meshing step, I put all the very small faces in a group (I used a small script to do that), so as to mesh them with specific parameters.Here is a HDF file which gives a 3.5 million node mesh if you compute it.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x3cnxmf252ek7eu/hclUja4rUeYou an see on the fuselage an irregular density distribution. This is because of the small edges that are in your geometry (and which, unfortunately, are not trivial to remove).William",

After importing the geometry in Salome the parametrization was lost.ThanksFeri",
                "Dear Feri,What is stored in iges and current step files are called \"dead CAD\": they only contain the final geometrical shapes of the drawing you done, but do not keep track of the way it has been built.Basically, iges and more preferably step are files to be used between a CAD program and a meshing program.The step is a format described by ISO norms (209, 233, 104...). There is a movement to norm also the way acccording to which parametric relations should be stored in step (as well as storing everything like full finite element models along with the CAD data...). But...I'm not sure about the progress of this movement... and before it is implemented in ProE (for saving) and Salome (for reading) it may happen a looooot of time...Another comment: this is also why CAD program have their own format: to store additionnal data that is not managed in standard data exchange formats.And finally, you have to know that to solve parametric relations, you need a \"parametric solver\" which is at the moment not the knid of tools very spread. It is a realy complex tool to developp because of the complexity of the problems it has to solve and the way the problem can be formulated... Currently, such a tool remains the reason why there is real difficulty for an open source CAD program to raise: thee isn't really a good open source parametric solver, even if this one on Google Code attract much attention from the 3 main open source CAD program development movements (FreeCAD, HeeksCAD and maybe even NaroCAD):SketchSolve:http://code.google.com/p/sketchsolve/pSketcher was also considered a while ago but appears interesting in the long term:http://code.google.com/p/psketcher/Hope this clarify the topic you raise.Best regards,Pierre",

I do not know which name to use or how to set it to be accessible in Cast3M.I have joined to this email a few files which correspond a simple geometry. \"tube.py\" generates the geometry in Salome, \"tube.med\" is the med file exported from Salome and \"tube.sauv\" is the file generated by med2sauv (the actual file is \"tube.med.sauv\", but it has been renamed to be loaded in Cast3M) and \"tube.dgibi\", to read the file \"tube.sauv\" into Cast3M.Thank you in advance for the help,Frederic Trillaud",

The point here is that you have not the geometry associated to your mesh since the mesh is extruded ... What I suggest is to create a group with all the elements after the extrusion (I found an elegant way to do that) :# Create a groupMainFace_Group = face_mesh.CreateEmptyGroup(smesh.SMESH.VOLUME, 'MainFace')nbAdd = MainFace_Group.Add(face_mesh.mesh.GetElementsByType(smesh.SMESH.VOLUME))With those lines, after an export med and a med2sauv, the object MAINFACE appears in castem.Regards, E.A."

I would like to have a fine mesh around the airfoil, and a coarser mesh in the rest of the domain.I tried two different strategies, but both failed.1) The strategy is to use 1D-2D-3D Netgen. It is not bad, but for any reason the mesh density is not constant in the extruded direction. See \"irregular.jpg\". If I export the geom in .step and mesh it directly in the Netgen GUI program, I don't have this problem.2) The strategy is to create groups of lines to control the element size on the lines.- I first create a relatively coarse mesh using \"Tetrahedron (netgen)\". I then have a regular mesh.- I create a submesh of the lines of the box to coarsen the mesh away from the airfoil. I re-compute the mesh. This step is ok.- I create a submesh on the lines of the airfoil to refine the mesh in the airfoil. But the mesh doesn't fit (see \"doesnt_fit.jpg\")Any suggestion?Thanks",

This catalog is\ndistributed in several files (general catalog,user catalog).  It will be assumed that the component will be declared in\na user’s personal catalog.  The component catalog file is an XML file that contains:the list of services of the component and their parametersthe name of the file containing the icon of the component, version\ninformation, comments, default service, etc. (this information is\noptional).This catalog can be completed by hand or a utility supplied by SALOME can be used that generates information in\npoint 1 above (nevertheless, this file must be edited to enter information in point 2).  This tool is available in\nthe SALOME graphic interface (Tools->CatalogGeneratormenu) indicating the name of the catalog (XML file) and\nthe name of the IDL file of the component.[...]but it's not said where is to be placed the catalog, or if it needs to be named following some convention... do you know something on that?ThanksAndrea",

I think the number of points should be Num = (Points)*Filets+1. The +1 is here to \"close\" correctly the shape in order the last point to be at the vertical of the first one. In my opinion, there is a problem with your V computation which does not start to 0 ... But I may miss something.2. The second point is quite difficult to find. Indeed, looking precisely at SolFilet shape, I have seen that its line generative is exactly at the same position than the cylinder itself. By experience, it can leads to boolean problem thus  I just add :from math import piFace = geompy.MakeRotation(Face, TangVec, math.pi/2)just after :Face = geompy.MakeFace(Circl, 0)now, it seems to work correctly at least on this simplified use case.",

Please find attached our script; it is ready to run in Salome.We have confirmed that the program does assign names to the components based on the x-component of the center of mass, and then by the y-component for pieces with the same x-component value. Thus with the three pieces in our sample script there is a 0-, 1-, and 2-component. You were correct; the component names are then appended to read 0_rotated, 1_rotated, and 2_rotated. We wrote a script then to sort our parts by this convention so that we could rename the components with more appropriate names. When the program executes (despite the convention it used to assign numbers) the order has been rearranged.In our sample script, if you comment out the last few lines were we reassign names, you will see the order of the components in our \"meshVolumeGroups\" list is [0_rotated, 2_rotated, 1_rotated], thus when we try to reassign names using SetName, the components appear with the incorrect names. The order of ascending x-component center of mass however has been confirmed to be 0_rotated -> 1_rotated -> 2_rotated.After running/reading through the script you will see that two of our component names get switched around.Any help or insight you can provide on our problem would be much appreciated.

All groups are symmetric. The order that the objects were returned should be by x position of center of mass: Blueleft, Redleft, greenleft, greenright, redright, blueright.  However, as shown in the image, the order is not consistent left to right, and is not following.  The order reported is Redleft, blueleft, greenleft, greenright, redright, blueright.There should not be this type of randomness in the order.  Is there a way to predict the order that items are returned?In cfdrc ace, there is a function to select objects by a given x,y,z position, then they could be renamed or otherwise operated on.  This looks to be sorely needed, and would be a quick and easy solution to this issue.  There would be no need to struggle to predict the order that a Salome command may return objects.Any advice?",

If I cut only 14 fins it needs a few minutes to create the geometry.Do someone know this problem or can get some hints how to speed up this process?Thanks!Michael",

                "Hello Edward,thank you for your reply.I generate a simple script to demonstrate this issue. Thereby I remarked that the long time is happend when I use a helix to extrude the fin. If I use only a vector it don't need the long time.If you select only 2 fins it will create very fast but if you increase the number of fins the time to create is disproportionately.Maybe you have some hints to speed up the process?!Best regardsMichael",
                "I had an idea about this problem a few days ago and it worked for me. You can check it herehttp://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/443901065My idea is that you create intermediate objects in the first stage and then you unite them by two. If you have 70 objects than I would suggest to:1. create 8 objects with 8-9 cuts on every one (let's say OBJ1-OBJ8) - 8 objects2. Unite the objects by two (OBJ_U_1=OBJ1+OBJ2, OBJ_U_2=OBJ3+0BJ4 ...) - 4 objects3. Unite the new ones (OBJ_U2_1=OBJ_U_1+OBJ_U_2) - 2 objects4. Unite the last two (FINAL_OBJ=OBJ_U2_1+OBJ_U2_2) - finalthis way  have managed to speed things up"

I spend time to study your  cases when I can (and it is a pleasure to help you when I find something) but I don't like to follow wrong directions ...Well, let's go back to your case...It seems that the geometry problem comes from the fact that the upper face of ship is not \"exactly\" co-planar to oz. The vertices coordinates of ship_vertex_29 and the upper faces are :ship_vertex_29 : -0.085421875 0.0 0.404Upper face : 4.999199 0.0 0.4038623Upper face : -0.085421875 0.0 0.404Upper face : 3.727748 0.4504063 0.4038623Upper face : 1.211587 0.4504063 0.4038622Upper face : -0.085421875 0.138403610092 0.403948325So what I've done is to cut the ship by a box co-planar to z and now the cutting of water by ship works ... To check that :1. runSalome test_ship.hdf2. dump study as \"test_ship.py\"3. GEOM --> Export ship as \"prova.stp\"4.

The reason of failure is very bad qualty of geometry: Max tolerance of vertex is ~2.8 while the size of the whole ship is (5.0 x 0.5 x 0.5).But I seem to find a solution for you. You can mesh the quadrilateral faces of ship separately from the rest domain (create a sub-mesh for this purpose) using Quadrangle mapping. This way you mesh the faces on which Netgen and Mefisto fail. 4 faces of ship that are not quadrilateral are successfully meshed by Netgen.As soon as 2D mesh is ready, split quadrangles into triangles (Modification/Cutting of Quadrangles), assign Netgen 3D and try to compute.Regards, SM",

Anyway, thanks a lot because now I know which is the way to solve such problems (and I'm just learning how to 'script' for SALOME on these weeks).@Saint Michael: your trick works for me, even if the mesh sucks - but it depends on the bad model. Thank you very much, I lernt I can obtain a 3D mesh through a 2D mesh and, above all, the 'quadrangles to triangles, if you can't create a triangle mesh' hint is very, very useful.I have other 2 little questions. It's not related with boolean cut operation troubles, but I met a (solved) problem, working on these test cases. I had a new ship geometry, builded a water domain and started with meshing operations. I tried first with Netgen/Mesfisto/Max size and had some problems with a face (too few edges or something similar), you can see it in the attached picture. It's a semi-circle, it closes a stern area (close to the propeller axle). I solved with an enough small max size. Then I applied a Netgen/Netgen 1D-2D/Max size and the algo worked fine at first time. I'd like to know:- why the first algo doesn't work with a larger max size? I mean, it's a MAX size.- what are the main difference in Mefisto and Netgen 1D-2D algos?Thanks for your kind attention.",
                "- why the first algo doesn't work with a larger max size? I mean, it's a MAX size.This is because, at too large segment size, the circular edge of semi-circle is meshed by only one segment, thus the whole face is meshed by zero area 2d element, that is considered as an error.- what are the main difference in Mefisto and Netgen 1D-2D algos?MEFISTO works in 2D space, which results in poor quality 3D mesh on surfaces with singularities (e.g. on sphere which looks like a rectangle in 2D space). NETGEN controls mesh quality in 3D space.MEFISTO has a sole parameter (max size), which is moreover not strictly respected. NETGEN is more flexible from this point of view, but it imposes uncontrolled dense discretization of curved edges and surfaces."

This happens only with stress results, not with displacement values.This strange things also happened in other analysis that used the \"extra-node\" for applying moments in a face; other analyses that do not use such resource are post-processed with no problems.

This fake solid has properties that simulate the contact. A thermal contact refers to as all the possible non perfect contacts that can exit between solids: bare contacts, gluing etc...2- Use the same approach than in mechanics, creating contact elements with particular properties as previously. I use this technique with the solver Cast3M and interweave it with the following last technique that I know of:3- Use an analogy with convection heat transfer where the net flux is computed between the solids: Phi1-Ph2 = h (T1-Tref)-h(T2-Tref) = h(T1-T2). In code_Aster, to do this, one has to use a function called ECHANGE_PAROI that allows to directly write that the transferred flux is equal to h(T1-T2). However, one need separating the two solids and create a matching mesh between the surface in thermal contacts.Thanks Saint Micheal, I am going to try it out.Best regards and thanks so far for the help,Frederic",

Therefore \nit makes no sense to use it to color a surface. You should use another \nfield of your MED file. This ELNO field will probably be hidden to users\n in a future version.Now if you want to have some information on an element, here is the procedure:1. Using the \"Selection controls\" toolbar, choose \"Select cells\",2. select the desired elements (they are highlighted in violet),3. Then add a \"Spreadsheet\" view (from top right button of the 3D view)4. In this spreadsheet you can choose to display all elements (select elements will be bold), or only selected elements.I hope this information can help you. Again sorry as I'm really not a paraview/PARAVIS specialist.Regards,Gilles",

If I have more information from the PARAVIS developers, I'll keep you informed.GillesGood news:How to display ELNO fieldsIt is necessary to add another step tp specify what we want to display using ELNO fields. For that 3 filters can be used in the submenu \"Integration Points\":ELNO Points: creates points on the vertices of the cells, with a shrink factor which allows you to make the distinction between the vertices of the adjacent cellsELNO Surface: this filters starts by extracting the surface of the object, then project the ELNO field on it, slightly separating the cells one from the others (10-5 shrink factor compared to cell initial size)ELNO Mesh: all the cells of the initial mesh are separated one from the others to be able to project the ELNO fields on them. Beware not to use this filter on big calculation cases as the memory used and the graphical performances are degraded. This filter allows to make operations such as Cut Planes keeping the ELNO fields correct.After applying one of those filters, the ELNO fields should be available in the \"Color by\" combo box.Best regards,Gilles",

You will receive a folder named like the mesh you exported. Rename that folder to \"polyMesh\" and copy it into your \"constant\"-directory and your mesh is imported. Be aware: You might have to adjust the constant/polyMesh/boundary-file for such things as symmetry or wedge-boundaries...Cheers,Bernhard",

In Salome, groups for meshing and groups for mesh zones are totally independent, and can overlap each other.Best regards,William",

Could anyone please advise on how I can work around it?Regards,Ran",

Additionally this happens when I load ASCII legacy VTK and I wish to format it to MED (I don't know why but data handling in MED format is much much better than plain ASCII VTK format).Basically I create a mesh in SMESH, then create a VTK file from it, as our computational program requires meshes in legacy ASCII vtk format (don't ask why, it is fortran90 code). It outputs results as additional FIELDS to that input VTK file. I could manually create MED file and populate it with the fields from the VTK file, but clicking save data is faster I guess.I have tried your method of usingPass arraysand yes, if I use it on Imported MED files then it works.

For some other test case it is altered by much larger value.Can someone comment on this issue.ThanksAbhishek",
                "Hello AbhishekThis effect is explained by the method of viscous layers construction. First the layer is inflated by normal to the geom surface and then, at certain condition, the internal surface of the layer is smoothed, causing elongation of distance between a node on the geom surface and a corresponding node on the internal surface of the layer.Actually, in the case you complain about, where a layer thickness is much less than size of elements, the smoothing can be omitted. I thought about implementing a check of this condition but nobody complained about this effect yet. Now, as you asked, I'll try to do it by the next release.Best regardsEdward",

                "Hi Edward,another quick question to that: I see the effect that altering the viscous layer thickness by an order of magnitude does not change significantly the resulting layer thickness of the mesh (even not at the front faces). Could the reason for this behavior also be the smoothing process? If yes, it would be great to have more control about it.All the best from Germany,David",

But for some models I have the effect that even though I am increasing the \"Layer thickness\" parameter in the hypothesis, the resulting layer is not really increasing. In a very extreme case I increased the layer thickness from 1e-4 to 8e-4 which led almost to the same layer thickness after computation. So I was wondering if this effect could also be due to the smoothing process?Best,David",
                "Hi DavidIt's hard to say for sure w/o looking at a model. Probably the thickness does not increase because it is limited in order to avoid collision with opposite faces.If you attach your study I will say precisely.Best regardsEdward",

                "Hello,The described behavior (when the \"eye\" icons are not initially shown) is a specific feature of the SALOME GUI architecture. SALOME GUI implements \"postponed loading\" of the libraries. This means that libraries for some module \"MODULE\"  are loaded in the memory only when it is explicitly required by the user. In your case, this will happen when you explicitly activate \"Geometry\" module by clicking its button in the toolbar. Such approach allows minimizing the time delay when opening study or activating some module. Another approach would be to load all libraries at once at SALOME GUI start-up, but in this case, when GUI session uses a lot of module, time required to open/create the study might become significant (some modules, are very \"heavy\", for example PARAVIS).On the other way, there's a bug that when you show some Geometry object from the associated \"Show\" popup menu command, the \"eye\" icons should be shown forallGeometry objects, not for the only one being shown. At this moment, Geometry libraries are loaded in memory and \"visibility\" state of all the Geometry objects should be updated.This bug will be analyzed, thanks for reporting it.Regards,Vadim.",

There must not be any pyramids in the mesh (for OpenFOAM)I have found that it is possible to fulfill requirement (1) by make a quadrilateral surface mesh and then splitting the quads into triangles.  I can then mesh the out boundary, make a compound mesh and add a 3d algorithm such as tetrahedron with a viscous layer hypothesis.  The problem is (a) the viscous layer hypothesis for a compound mesh doesn't enable me select what surfaces to apply it to, and (b) it doesn't generate any viscous layers at all anyway.I have attached these steps in the attached python dump.Is there a way of either making the viscous layer work for the compound mesh, or somehow making the regular triangular surface mesh directly so that I can avoid making a compound mesh?  Any help is much appreciated!Cheers,Dan",

                "Hello,I am having troubles with loading existing hdf-files from within a python script.I am aware that this question has been posted here before a couple of times, but the answers given there do not work for me.Briefly, what I intend to do is the following:I wish to split my Salome workflow into sections that deal with geometry only, and mesh only, respectively. Ideally, Icreate a python file with geometry specifications;save the geometry, either manually or programmatically from within the script, as an hdf-file;load the hdf-file from within another python file that deals with mesh creation only.The idea behind this is to save time when the geometry and/or mesh are so complex as to take up a lot of time when produced from the python script directly; instead, once the geometry is done, I could load it from the hdf-file and subsequently work upon mesh specifications.I have tried the recipes given here in this forum to achieve step 3 above, but have always failed so far. The reason is that, once the hdf-file is loaded from within the second script, geometry objects are no longer recognized by the names they have been given in the first script.As an example, and in order for you to reproduce the error, I am attaching 3 files:test_geom.py , which contains the geometry in terms of python commands;test_geom.hdf , which has been manually saved from within the GUI once test_geom.py has run through;test_mesh.py , which is the file I want to get working.Within test_geom.py, there are two objects, Glue_1 and Face_1, that are referenced in test_mesh.py for the purpose of mesh/submesh creation. But they are not recognized, instead producing an errorNameError: name 'Glue_1' is not defined .Needless to say, the objects and their names are still there, fully contained in the hdf-file, as can be seen when the latter is loaded manually into the GUI via File > Open.So what am I doing wrong?Many thanks for your answer.p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }",

But, when I do: mesh.GetElemNodes(elem_id) it returns something like this:[5, 5, 7, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 5, 7, 8, 4, 5, 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2]where nodes of all faces are (randomly?) mixed and repeated.When I go to the GUI and go to Mesh > Mesh Information > Element Info, it shows something like this:Volume: #740174>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type: Polyhedron<br>\n    Quadratic: No>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connectivity<br>\n        Face 1 / 6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 5  8: #5>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 7  8: #7>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 3  8: #3>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 1  8: #1>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face 2  6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 2  8: #2>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 6  8: #6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 5  8: #5>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 1  8: #1>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face 3  6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 6  8: #6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 8  8: #8>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 7  8: #7>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 5  8: #5>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face 4  6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 7  8: #7>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 8  8: #8>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 4  8: #4>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 3  8: #3>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face 5  6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 4  8: #4>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 8  8: #8>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 6  8: #6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 2  8: #2>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face 6  6>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 3  8: #3>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 4  8: #4>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 2  8: #2>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node 1  8: #1>\n(...)<strong>One can see \"Node 5/8\", \"Node 7/8\", etc. So, Salome knows the order of the 8 nodes in the element.

With a little bit more complex geometry (over 100 contact pairs) it seems that makefuselist command is very slow. it takes more than half an hour to make all construction geometry and makefuselist also crashes easily.

When fused together the shape was polyhedron.  Lying on geom filter does not work with boxes (and neither with componds) but works with polyhedrons.Is there a way to transform these boxes into polyhedrons efficiently or some other way to use these boxes to filter elements?Also is it possible to unpublish mesh elements so that I can use them in python script but cannot be seen in GUI?I really appreciate your help..

                "HelloI want to explain why your first approach (with FT_BelongToGeom and FT_LyingOnGeom filters), which seems to be the most proper one in your case,  does not work.This is because a filtering algorithm works different depending on whether a threshold shape in a sub-shape of the meshed geometry or not. If the threshold shape is a sub-shape of the main shape, then distance between nodes and the sub-shape is NOT measured, and node-to-shape association is used instead. Tolerance is not used in this case.  In the other case distance is measured and Tolerance is used.So, to get your approach working, you can copy the shapes you use as Threshold, e.g. by Translating them by (0,0,0).Alternatively you can copy your mesh. This will work because if no node-to-shape association is present, then distance measurement is used.I updated SMESH documentation to make this dark point clear.Best regardsEdward",

You just need to createtwoone sub-mesh (source face +target face) and use the 3D extrusion +Quadrangles+ Nb. Segment (of Local Lenght) algos/hypos.

As you see, to generate 5 layers, I need to define group of surface elements in each step and extrude that group. I select those faces manually which is time consuming.2. final volume is not smooth, so what I can do is  (a) generate new volume element on the step regions (b) use \"smooth\" function in Salome which generates a random volume and destroys the boundaries. since this part is in touch with other components, I need to keep some nodes fixed, which need to select them manually.what would you suggest to generate such volume on such shell group (via Salome or Code-Aster)?Thanks,BME",
                "Hi Robert,Attached is a script doing an extrusion of each face of a mesh given a distance. Groups of faces and of volume are generated, so you can add several layers.For each node, we take the mean vector of all adjacent faces normal, like in Code_Aster's CREA_MAILLAGE/COQU_VOLU.Christophe",
                "Hi Christophe,That is a great piece of code you posted there. Looks like the ultimate tool for 3D viscous layer generation. I could create a BL for a 3D blade in 5 minutes. I'll play around a bit more and let you know how it goes.Thanks a lot !",
                "Christophe,After playing around with yoru script, I could not manage to add the fluid the domain on top of the extruded mesh your script builds. Let me explain further.We start with an aircraft wing for instance. using your script, it is very easy to build a 3D mesh, offset from the surface, which is a perfect boundary layer for CFD analysis. Then we need to enclose that new mesh inside our domain, typically a box. Mesh quality is not that important here, netgen 1D2D3D would be perfect for that. But I couldn't find a way to do it.Any input would be great. If we can get that to work, Salome becomes VERY attractive for CFD meshes I think.",
                "Christophe, your script is a gem !I am happy to learn from it.The last step is (I tried to do it a while ago): stretch an existing volume mesh so as to insert the prisms. The main issue is, of course, to deform the volume mesh smoothly. Because, in a high quality mesh, the size of the last layer is equal to the size of the unstructured elements touching this layer. So, simply displacing nodes touching the wall to the upper layer position generates negative volumes and very low mesh quality.Also, fusing the volume mesh with prisms can be time consuming.Best regards,William",

Display orientation of faces to be sure the normals are going out of the domain on each shell.@WilliamThank you, but I am not an expert in CFD meshing as you areI have just reproduced the behaviour of a Code_Aster functionality. The extrusion is done with a constant size, it gives some elements bigger than the others at the corner. When creating new nodes it would be better to interpolate along the whole surface to smooth the elements size. That's what the hypotheses Viscous Layers are for. Can you post a picture of your precise problem?For advance needs in viscous layers (management of multi-normals, reducing the extrusion to avoid penetration of two  viscous layers in vis-a-vis...), Distene provides an hybrid mesher that seems promising (but not free), seehttp://www.meshgems.com/meshing/focus-on/hexes-or-tets-take-the-best-of-both-worlds/Christophe",

You have to make the imprint of the viscous layer on the box so as to have the complementary domain.Attached is a script doing the job on a O-grid.For the trailing edge, you can create an independent mesh on the face, extrude it to generate viscous layers in both directions, and proceed as before to take it into account in the complementary domain (or simply create a 2D sub-mesh on this domain).Christophe",

Starting with the BL created with the Ogrid approach, with a thin trailing edge, I tried removing the cells at the rear, in order to add the ones generated from extruding the 2D mesh from the TE plane. However there's a missing cell then, because the last vertex on the foil is then not at the TE anymore...I guess I could do it the hard way, creating vertices etc... But I feel like there's a more clever way to do that, maybe directly changing your script doing the normals, but I could not figure it out.Using a thick trailing edge works quite well, but then you dont get a thin TE... any idea ??thanks !I'll prepare two other scripts, one doing a 2D foil, single cell in z, and the other doing a 3D foil, so that everybody can use it.",

Everything is fine except the mesh creation. It says some edges are duplicate or something like that.I used one of the previously built faces instead of 'create boundary elements\", because that one also picked the inner boundary which is the profile itself.cheers.",
                "There seems to be a bug: on non planar quadrangles, pyramids are generated on both sides of the wing (inner and outer).If you split quadrangles into triangles before Compute, the mesh ends fine (but you don't want triangles).In fact, in your case, you don't want those oblique faces on the transition between perpendicular sides of the wing. Instead, you need a right angle for the viscous layer and 2 volume elements joining in the corner of each layer with a diagonal face. See attached scheme.",
                "Here is another version of the script, improved to generate right angles viscous layers on intersecting faces.But since no smoothing is done, elements at  the corners get bigger and bigger at each layer step.Still not usable in CFD IMHO.",
                "Christophe,Your first version is perfect for me. The problem you shown at the corners isn't important at all.In a high quality mesh, the surface cell size is very smaller and (in my case) the prismatic layer is very thinner.In consequence, it doesn't matter if some cells are not so good at the back left corner of the wing. The most important is that there are good everywhere else! With prisms being well perpendicular to the wall (and I am afraid any smoothing operation can corrupt this).I love your first version. I made some tests and it is very good. I would like this very simple and robust algo to be implemented in Salome, so as to be used with the Netgen algo like the actual one.",

                "Dear Community,I recently started working with Salome and so far I learned a lot.Nevertheless I want to have detailed information about a quiete easy case.It is related to a classic transition from a cylindric pipe to a rectangular  domain. In order to reduce the cell count I want to mesh this problem with \"3D Mesh Extrusion\". If anybody has a different, more easy way, to mesh this geometry with at least prisms or even hexas - welcomeMaybe its possible to convert tetras to hexas, too.I build up a minimal example, see attachement:It's about a geometry with 2 cylinders, 1 inside a rectangular box ( the lower one) and one above the box. Meshing is done for the 2 cylinders, including a node spacing function for the nodes that were extruded (in z direction).I wanted to have the same node spacing in z direction for the box as I have for the lower cylinder and it took me one day to find out, that I have to define 2 edges of the box with the spacing I want (and edge in extrusion direction of the outer hull, and one of the inner). Is this a \"must\"?Generally  I am unsure about the 3D Extrusion methology:1.  Defining the \"Main Mesh\" with its 3D method \"3D Extrusion\" I have to enter a 2D method -> I always define \"Quadrangle Mapping\" since this is the \"outer shell\" of the extrusion and hence has to be mapped, right?2.  For the 1D Method I am unsure when to use \"Number of Segments\" or \"Max size\", or anything else. So far I basically use \"Nb. of Segments\". Are there specific distinctions?3. I recognized that entering values here affect the node count in the circumferential direction of the face and the axial (extrusion) direction -> is that right? Furthermore I figured out that the node count in extrusion direction can later be edited by assigning a sub mesh to one of the edges in extrusion direction. This is what I did for the 2 cylinders and did twice for the box.4.  The 2 required Sub-Meshes for 3D Extrusion: Top face of the extrusion requires a 2D method, this is clear . What is 1D in this case? Circumferential direction of this face?? Does it have a second meaning as for the main mesh?5.  The bottom face of the extrusion gets a 2D Projection from the top face of the body (or any body which is \"in-line\", like the top face of my upper cylinder related to the bottom face of my lower cylinder)?. Again, what is 1D here? Circumferential, or can I assign a node spacing for extrusion here?To sum up with the spacing in extrusion direction: It is definitely a must to have one or more extra edges defined within sub meshes to get the desired spacing? -> For my example I do this only to have a BL resolution at the top & bottom of the box. Is it also possible to overcome this by defining a viscous layer in one of the 2D algorithms?I hope anyone can help me with this extrusion topic. I also tried to skip the lower cylinder, but this failed in 3D Extrusion of the box.Thanks in advance,Cheers, Guido",

Also I have many of these manifolds (with these cylinders) discharging into a header.Starting from my current modeling approach, I would need to enter, say 50+ 3D extrusions. Is there a way to reduce the amount of work here?I already put the whole geometry into 1 partition (in order to have a conformal mesh.. btw: is this the only way?) and then grouped the respective faces for my extrusion.

In my experience the STL file generated directly from the geom module is very low quality.  Frequently  snappyHexMesh  was not able to use the STL file so every time i want to use in OpenFOAM a STL file generated in SALOME i have to repair it with a 3rd software.The problems that i encounter are mainly related to  fillets or irregular curved surfaces ( i.e. the one generated by the \"close holes\" functions. The problems are of all sorts like small holes, double elements, elements with limit shapes (very high aspect shapes.) or low quality of the reproduction ( like appearance of bumps in a circular shape, so not only  resolution problems).From my side the improvement of this tool is one of a critical factor in the usability of Salome even for small CAD projects.Best Regardsfrancesco",

That is why very little attention is paid to its validity and quality (from FEA point of view).Hello Edward,I belong to users who would be happy to have higher quality STL export in the Geom module.For example, I often prepare geometries for STARCCM+ with Salome. And the STL format is very practical in this context. The need of meshing the geometry in the Mesh module before export is time consuming.I would be glad to be able to have some precision parameter in the Geom module of Salome when exporting STL files, not to export meshes ready for FEM, but at least which conserve the geometry.I enclose a screenshot of STL file exported from the Geometry module and imported in Star. You can see that the leading edge of the wing is too much deformed.Inversely, tessellate a similar geometry in Star before exporting into STL takes few tenths of second and the geometry is perfectly conserved.Best regards,William",

This is particularly true if you want to have identical viscous layers also in the extruded meshes.Up to now for a new version of the mesh I deactivate the extruded meshes, then remesh the initial mesh, then activate the extrusions again and mesh the whole mesh. Particularly if the initial mesh is complicated, this is uncomfortable as I have to wait before I can start the next step.Is there a way to define a sequence of mesh computations for the different submeshes of a compound?If there is not, I think it might be a nice addition for the next release...(If needed, I will be happy to supply a more elaborate concept of what I am thinking of.)Cheers,Bernhard",

Thank you already in advance!I. So far I have set up a very basic case (see Dump in the attachment).- The geometry consists of a cube with 2000 mm sides.- A cylinder starting at 500 500 0 with radius 300 and height 800 is produced as well.- For the cube there are named faces and edges, as well as groups for the faces and the cube itself- For the cylinder there is a group for the cylinder.II. The cube by now is meshed with 15 cells per direction in equidistant manner with the standard set of hypotheses for hexahedric meshes.III. The goal of this very basic case (which should be nice for using it as a tutorial) is to have the mesh of the cube refined with HOMARD in the region of the cylinder.- What are the right settings for exporting this mesh to a MED-file as it is used in HOMARD?- The steps I tried so far: Mark the mesh and export to MED with the different options possible.- Import of the mesh into HOMARD fails. After defining the directory for the case (a directory created in the very window for chosing the directory) and the med-file, I click \"Apply\". As soon as I click on \"OK\" I receive a message stating \"The directory /home/name/newdir is already used for the case Case_1\".At this point I fail to have further ideas. Any suggestions?Obviously, the part for refinement is still missing as well...IV. Finally the mesh should be exported to an OpenFOAM-case, if possible.- If there is a way of opening the MED-file within SMESH or of exporting it back to the hdf-format I would use the salomeToOpenFoam-script provided in this very forum by Nicolas.- Other suggestions in case that retransformation is not possible are welcome!So far for my efforts, I hope for fruitful answers!As soon as this complete set works, I will produce a full tutorial including descriptions of the single steps. Which of course I will make available to the Salome-people for proper use.Cheers,Bernhard",

After installing from the Universal Binaries for Linux not only much more modules as usually are available, the script also does run until the end without problems.I even get a nice mesh in the end which contains a refined part. Although I definitely will still play some more with the possibilities of adaptation, that is already very close to what I hoped for.

When you open the study from hdf file, no geometrical operation is performed, geometry and groups are just read from the file, but when you launch the script all operations that led to the result state are re-performed. And since there probably were some changes in modeling algorithms that the script invoke, order of sub-shapes changes and contents of groups change correspondingly.To have more stable group contents its possible to use sorted sequence of sub-shapes to create groups. For example in line #86 of your script there is a command returning the sorted list of faces of 'domino':[Face_1,Face_2,Face_3,Face_4, ... ] = geompy.ExtractShapes(dominio, geompy.ShapeType[\"FACE\"], True)Using these faces we can have stable group contents:inlet = geompy.CreateGroup(dominio, geompy.ShapeType[\"FACE\"])# geompy.UnionIDs(inlet, [385])geompy.UnionList(inlet, [Face_<n>])I experimented with your study to reproduce \"Missing Index\" problem but did not succeed.

This means you can not use ImportComponentGUI() function. Indeed, if you try to invoke it, you'll see the following message in the console:>>> gg = salome.ImportComponentGUI(\"SMESH\")Warning: ImportComponentGUI( SMESH ) outside GUI !calls to GUI methods may crash...This also means that you cannot display / erase objects from external Python console.Regards,Vadim.",

In GUI I can choose objects by clicking, but in TUI I need to analyze their location. Easy checks, such as \"if ((x<X0) and (y < Y0))\" won't work for curved shapes, and the easiest way I can imagine is to get  a point by MakeCDG() of subshape and check if it is situated inside a solid.I can create a compound from subshape and a solid, and check self-intersection, but this way is too time expensive.So, is there any built-in functions to identify subshape's ancestor in gluing compound?",

STEP file importing often generates some problems about following geometries operations because of the strange scaling to 0.001, but I'm sometimes able to fix with alternative procedure. Anyway, I think there are other problems too and maybe I can fix it by tolerance settings. The models are created in Rhinoceros and pass all checks. I work inmm(my blades are about 200 mm), with an absolute tolerance of0.01. OK, I can try with an higher tolerance of0.1or1. Anyway, now I'm focusing on SALOME platform. In the Preferences section I read:Length precision: 6Length tolerance precision: -9and other default options.Wich are your suggestions in order to conciliate Rhinoceros and SALOME? Maybe SALOME default settings are too accurate for my geometry and my typical operations (partition, scale, cut, intersect, fuse). Has anyone experience about that? And I also think ofRepair/SewingorRepair/Glue faces: in your opinion, could these operations fix my problems? I'm really confused because I know that SALOME is not based on units, so I don't know how to proceed.Thanks for your attention, best regards.",

I suggest decreasing tolerance of the imported geometry using \"Repare/Limit tolerance\" at least down to the default 1e-7. If \"Limit tolerance\" reports invalid result shape, try again with a higher tolerance.BR, St. Michael",

Anyway, I'll try repair the imported model withLimit toleranceoption, before and after scaling the STEP file (because I don't know the effects of the repairing tools on 'just imported' STEP files, I already realized other operations often 'explode').",

In these cases tolerance is usually optimal for further operations.As about imported shapes, probably SALOME uses tolerances written in the exported file. You can find it out. Try different values of tolerance at export from Rhinoceros and check tolerance of the imported shape in SALOME (menu Measures/Tolerance). It is very interesting if there is some correlation.",

If you only knew how much time I've wasted on this..What approach would you suggest to refine the mesh in the areas where the wires cross?As far as I know, in \"NetGen 2D Parameters - local sizes\" you cannot choose a mesh group as faces. So what I am considering on doing now would be:1. Import STL's to Geometry Mode2. Define the areas of interest as Face Groups(I've tried this and faced some problems: 1. this takes so much more time than defining them in Mesh Mode, 2. when I select the faces of one side of the wire also the faces of the back side of the wire are selected)3. Go back to Mesh Mode and Mesh each of them with NetGen 2D-1D and local sizes as parameter4. Then use your approach from aboveWould you agree on that?",

I select the tolerance using Merge Nodes dialog, manual mode.2. Create Group_2 of triangles including nodes of Group_1.Mesh > Group based on nodes of other group, Element type = Face, Number of nodes = At least one.3. Fill holes in Group_2 by creating another group Group_3, the same way as Group_2, using Group_2 as input.4. Export Group_3 in a STL file.5 Import the STL file in Geometry module.

                "I'm afraid that geometries are not associative in Salome: it means that if you move the plane of a sketch (admitting to be able to do this) the sketch will not follow the new position of the plane, same behaviour for the features. I'm a solid-edge user in my every-day life, so I understand you perfectly, but to modify a solid and to make it parametric/associative is a very difficult and time-consuming work. More, Salome does not support any kind of link to external file (a concept similar to the X-refs in Autocad), so it is very difficult to re-use a part that was already modeled in another assembly.The only thing that you can do is to make an heavy use of parameters (function: notebook) but this require to preview all parameters (and equations) that we will need, before starting to model the part. In a few words, it is necessary to design the process of the modelization before the kick-off.Previously Alex wrote:Hi CacciatorinoThx a lot...  this is more similar to SolidWorks or Catia workflow....Since I plan to make assemblies in Salome platform, and I cannot move freely components, using feature matching techniques of some Commercial cad packages ( surface/ vector matching , etc )  I will need to design my components \"in-place\" in the assembly...",

                "So I am new to Salome (and OpenFoam for that matter) and I am evaluating Salome. We use Solidworks as our CAD package and I have fairly complex geometry that I want to group into a lot of different parts so I can get forces/moments on each in the end. I've attached a picture of a semi tractor that we use in CFD and I was wondering if anyone could offer some feedback on whether Salome is the right tool for me, and if so, how can I go about grouping different components.I am currently having trouble grouping components because some parts may have 100+ faces on it and I have trouble selecting them all at once. So I would like to select a bunch of the faces, add it to the group (like bumper), then hide what I have already selected so I can continue selecting the rest and add them to the same group.Also, the explode option seems great, except if you are familiar with Solidworks, I take my assembly, make it a part, and then combine all solids which touch each other so that they get trimmed by any intersection. It also prevents two butting faces from being imported in if I left it as an assembly. Each solid part in an assembly would maintain all sides (including sides that do not see airflow, versus combining everything leaves only the outside surfaces.Any thoughts/suggestions on Grouping, programs and my overall process?Also, does Salome run much quicker in Linux than Windows? (currently trying it out in Windows)",
                "HiIMHO Salome is not suitable for such complex models as yours. During creation of a group you can hide already added faces, but I suppose that Salome will work very slowly with a model including so many faces.Another difficulty is that to get a conformal mesh in Salome, you are to apply Partition or Glue Faces to your model. I'm almost sure that Salome will fail at this step because of a high complexity of the model.St.Michael",

Further from the body using such a scheme, the \"remaining\" areas to mesh resemble the body with no wings, so you should not have any issues.In my experience, for quadrangle/hexahedra blocking schemes, it is better (though more labor intensive) to use a \"bottom up\" approach (defining points, edges, then faces, and building a compound mesh) rather than a \"top down\" approach (i.e. partitioning a complex shape), as you do not have fine control over what sub-shapes are built by the partitioning). The Salome GUI does not encourage this approach (or does not seem thought out for it), and I may be influenced by experience with other tools, but using this approach should work.Regards,",
                "Thank you very much, Yvan. I'm going to try with your blocking scheme: I didn't know blocks can be internal...

What does it mean? How can i fix it?",
                "Hello,Pyramid elements may be generated by SMESH, and exist in the MED format, but do not exist in the UNV format specification, so converters could either export them as degenerate hexahadra (with 4 merged vertices), or ignore them. Most choose to ignore them, as is the case here, which means you are more or less stuck, unless you can find a way not to generate pyramid elements (either not using quadrangle mapping, or doing full blocking, but not mixing both, as this will require pyramids fo the transition at some point).The best solution for OpenFoam would be to add a MEDtoFoam converter, as the MED format can handle pyramids, polyhedra,... but this would require someone working with OpenFoam contributing it...",
                "OK, I've learned something newIn the meantime I tried to generate a hex mesh for the same geometry (something like in the attached pictures). First I builded the holed block (and partitioned it), then I added the sorrounding blocks. I thought to 'fuse' them but it didn't work (some parts of the central block disappeared), so I builded a compound solid. Am i right? Now I have a little problem: I want to have one layer of cells in the thickness, so I think I must exploded all the vertical little edges and group of them, becouse I can't distinct them (in a parallelepiped block I can explode ONE of them and then propagate the 1D hypothesis on the opposite ones). Am I right? I'm sorry for the stupid questions. Thanks again for your help.",

It is based on a variational rather than a Delaunay or a frontal approach so you might have different results. The new mesher is also multithreaded. You can find it at:https://github.com/MoiseRousseau/Variational-Tet-MeshAlso, can you send your salome sutdy with your geometry and possibility with the mesh if not too heavy (for example,https://wetransfer.com/) ? I created a small piece of software that allow optimizing mesh orthogonality, but I need further tests to get it works and increase its performance.

If you want previous Script files ofcourse I can share everything with you.But If I can solve the Fusing error and fuse the cylinders with spheres succefully, I will generate mesh with SALOME because I need grouping them by their height. With snappyHexMesh and a STL file this is not possible.In short I'll generate the mesh when I'm done with this error.

When I try to mesh the two bodies I get the following error:\"NgException at Volume meshing: Stop meshing since boundary mesh is overlapping\"How do I create a mulit-body mesh with coincident faces?I can see from the surface mesh created (prior to error) that coincident edges are meshed much finer than elsewhere (see screen shot). It seems that the mesher is aware of adjacent bodies and tries to compensate. In this case, I do not need a conformal mesh. I just want each block meshed independently.I have tried meshing the blocks separately and then creating a compound mesh. With this approach I get what I need except for two problems:(1) When I import the mesh to SimScale the two bodies are treated as one volume (is this to be expected?).(2) The compound mesh is no longer associated with the geometry. So if I create a new mesh group the compound mesh must be created again.Any help with this would be much appreciated.Regards, Ben",

The project I am working on consists of a single bolted L shaped beam which is loaded in tension:https://postimg.org/image/605rf7s0n/I am trying to create a group of faces where the bolt will hit the beam in order to define my contact later on in Code_Aster. Despite having exploded the corresponding faces from the solid in the geometry module, I am unable to create a valid group in the meshing section of the program.https://postimg.org/image/kgt0tshhz/https://postimg.org/image/71604c907/I faced this very same problem when I attempted to create groups from geometry for both extremities of the beam in order to apply BCs and loading. Creating a sub-mesh and then creating a group from the elements of the sub-mesh fixed the issue. However, it did not work for the contact group I am currently trying to define.Hopefully someone on this forum can help me find a solution to my problem. I am a rather new user of both Salomé and Code_Aster, so bear with me. I also attached the .hdf file I am using:http://www.filedropper.com/64x64x64I know it is quite messy. The geometry element where the exploded contact faces are located is called 64x64x6.4. The mesh onto which I am trying to create a group with those faces is also called 64x64x6.4.Best regards,S.

Why doesn't the merge nodes operation do that?  That's what it should be doing!2. Why doesn't the merge nodes GUI have a field specifying a tolerance value to be considered?3. How do I write a TUI script automatically sew the edge nodes so that one can get a closed mesh?4. I wish the GUI / TUI would use geometric features for the sewing operation which is a higher level of interaction that at the node/element level.Since the wire is not a simple one it poses some difficulties for me and does not appear to be conducive to the sew operations of the GUI that require one to input starting nodes, successive node and ending nodes, etc.  Secondly, it become difficult when a model is parametric.  It is useful when the geometry is simple as illustrated in the documentation, but quickly becomes impractical when beyond that, unless I am missing something obvious.  Thank you for any help I can get.Regards,JMB",

But it can't work on your case since you juste have the CAO of the base edge.Hello Cristophe Bourcier,Thank you for your detailed reply.  Let me re-iterate some points:1. Yes I did merge both nodes and elements, yet there is an open edge that cannot be easily closed via just merge nodes/elements.  I will post an example of the problem after about a week.2. That is precisely my point.  If a tolerance zone CAN be specified, then merging nodes that are not co-incident (but fall within the zone of tolerance) should become eligible for merger. This may result in some degenerate (collapsed) elements, but that would become the user's problem (fault) for making the tolerance too generous.3. Thanks for the suggestion I will explore it.4. What I am suggesting is the higher level of CAD (CAO) information is available.  It is the profile (say: \"Wire_1\") that created the 1D elements.  The 2D mesh should be made capable of recognizing that the nodes to be merged all happen to lie on Wire_1 and therefore are candidates for merger.Regards, JMB",

                "Hi Hasan,It would be helpful if you could attach your geometry file/python script so that people can get a better understanding of what you are referring to.Is your geometry one single solid? Could you explode it out/partition it in such a way to allow you only look at the faces of a smaller object (if Salome is just taking exception at the number of faces you are asking it to look at).Alternatively, though I don't know if it would give any better results, you could try exploding your geometry by faces, change your sub-shapes type to face and chose Select sub-shapes. Then chose the faces you require and then group from these. Though as I say, this might just result in the same thing happening when you try to view all the faces.cheersSusan",
                "Hi HasanProbably your problem with group creation caused by a large number of faces in your model. Though this is strange anyway. Maybe SALOME would unfreeze in a while.An alternative solution is to create a group in a Python script using searching function available. It's hard to advise a proper function without seeing a model. For example geompy.GetShapesOnShape() can help in selecting faces located inside a solid, say a box.Note that to make a mesh group on geom faces, it's not obligatory to create a geom group, it's enough to get a compound of faces that is often a result shape returned by the searching functions.St. Michael",

                "Hello,Having a quick look to your geometry, I would say that the small gaps inside your honey comb structure can explain that the mesh is infinitely long to compute.See the screenshot.Rebuilding this structure more properly would for sure accelerate the mesh generation. Do it in Salome shouldn't be so time consuming using all the possibilities of the Geometry module (likeOperations>Transformation>Multi-Translation).A state-of-art solution would be to create a blocking mesh in/on the honey comb structure, so that it can be meshed very quickly and properly, and to use unstructured  mesh for the rest. It is, of course, possible. Depending on how much energy you want to put in it.William",
                "HelloEnclosed is a picture illustrating what I mean about the blocking mesh on the honey comb structureI think it should accelerate + increase the quality of the mesh.

So I used these names of groups. But it does not seem to influence the result (I tried without, and I got exactly the same results forMesh,MeshPiercedDiscandMeshCompound, except for \"_required_xx\" lines which disappeared).Regards,Megane",
                "Hi MeganeI see now what labels you mean, I see they are equal to IDs of geom entities porting nodes and elements. Hence Compound mesh does not fit your needs at all.I think the simplest solution is to use Partition approach + \"Import ...\" algorithm which is very fast. You have to create a sub-mesh for each face ofGeomwithinPartitionin order to copy (\"import\") mesh from a corresponding face ofMesh.I attach a script doing this automatically, you can use it to accomplish your task. It creates all needed sub-meshes. My Divided_Disk_1 represents yourGeom.St.Michael",
                "Hi St. Michael,Your \"partition+import\" approach works very well. Moreover, I did not know where did these labels come from ; indeed it seems logical. It will be useful for my future work. Thank you very much for your help and interesting explanations!Best regards,Megane"

And snappyHexMesh is tool that suitable for simple and complex meshes. But it's too difficult to make high quality mesh with it.Previously William Tougeron wrote:Hello RomanWhat kind of geometry do you want to mesh?Can you enclose some screenshot example?I know well blocking with ICEM CFD, and that's true that until Salome 6.5.0, ICEM was still the best tool I know for blocking (even if sometimes, ICEM makes very strange things that can be solved in Salome). Salome is however perfect for hybrid meshing, which seems more difficult in ICEM CFD.I know also well blockmesh in OpenFOAM and I think Salome Geom + Mesh modules is easier to use, even if Salome necessites many hours of use before taking advantage of all its power. (But one solution could be to develop some Python script to export blockmesh files from Salome, so as to have a GUI for blockmesh a bit similar to Discretizer but more sofisticated. This could be interresting...). If Salome isn't suitable for complex geometries, blockmesh is worse! (I know it from experience...)It is just my opinion, but I think Hexablock is not as powerful as ICEM CFD yet since it is very new, but maybe in the future it will be very much powerful.Best regards,WilliamPS: I am also interrested in the .STEP files needed for the TUI tutorials",

I made it from scratch in one hour.Some useful tools I used to complete this job: 2D Sketch + Revolution, Divided Disk (version Salome 6.6.0 or more), Partition, Projection, Explode, Filling, Create Plane (from face, from three points)...If you want viscous layers discretization, I think indeed that Salome Geom + Mesh becomes a bit limited.

Create three 1D-Groups: one for all radial lines, one for all arcs and one for the depth-directed lines9. Mesh on the glued ring: automatic hexahedralization (1D-hypothesis is not used but assign it anyway)10. create SubMeshes on Mesh: one for each 1D-Group (Geometry: <1D-Group>, Algo: wire discretisation,assign new Hypothesis: Number of Segments)11. Compute the MeshNow you'll have a hexahedrc mesh which you can control in all 3 dimensions with manipulating the three hypothesises.The 1D-Groups and subMeshes are optional to control the element numbers. (step 7,8 and 10)Here is a picture how the diameter shall looks like.The way the tutorial leads you (to break a circle into 90 degree parts) is also fit to do the job.

After the 2d mesh has been created, the work to create a 3d mesh is just a couple of click ahead.To be honest, I asked in the forum because I was a little bit concerned about the difficulty to create a hexa-mesh on a simple solid, and I was convinced that I was making an error in my procedure to create the mesh.Thank you very much for you valuable help.",
                "Dear Cacciatorino,there is nothing you have to apologize for. I'm not angry about you.I'm not a native speaker and my post may sounded different as it was meant. Sorry for that.Please understand my increased accuracy. I use meshes for fluid dynamic purposes.The Demands on the mesh quality and control are quite high so I need to be accurate.Besides that your thoughts are right: Keep it as simple as you can to save resources.But you need a closed shell of 2D elements to build 3D cells.Revolving a mesh?Machines don't think. So you can't left them freedom in construction or errors would occure.I added a ring part just to show you what could be the result, if nobody specify the revolved dimension.(Mesh revolving is not possible I deformed the mesh with intent.)And don't be afraid of my worflow above. For this example mesh I needed less than 5 minutes from Zero to Mesh.You can't build a mesh without a geometric shape and revolution is just a tool which does the work for you but it's not a shape itself. Thats why meshes can't be created by revolving.But you can easily split geometries with partitioning by planes, with the goal to reduce the edges per face to four.I hope I got the reason of the problem across to you, so that you now what can be done and what's impossible.Best Regards,Robert",

                "Hi again,Thanks for your answer. I still have some questions wrt mesh refinement that can best be explained with the \"Maximum Element Volume\" script found here:http://docs.salome-platform.org/7/gui/SMESH/tui_defining_hypotheses_page.html#tui_max_element_volume.It is also attached to this post.(1)The 1D hypothesis disintegrates all edges to 7 pieces. The circles segments are therefore L = 2*pi*50/7 =~ 27 long.Now I don't understand how the 2D hypothesis MaxElementArea(150.) is working. If the argument in MaxElementArea is actually the allowed maximum area of a given face, then 150 is a lot smaller than the surface area of an equilateral triangle with side length L: A = 0.5*L^2*sin(60) =~ 316.But most of the mesh triangles are size ~316 (as the algorithm is aiming for equilateral triangles).So what does the '150' relate to? It is not the upper bound for the surface area.(2)If I now change the 2D hypothesis to MaxElementArea(50.) I see that the the triangles on the cylinder surface are smaller. Great! But the triangles on the cylinder top and bottom are not affected by it, although the 2D hypothesis should act on the whole body surface.How can I fix this?I tried to find answers to these two questions in the forum and the documentation but the refinement is still mysterious to me. I hope you can shed some light on it.Cheers,Fynn",

                "Dear Salome Users,recently I have started to use CalculiX for my FE simulations and SALOME for meshing. Unfortunately I have some problems with Creating Groups for my meshes. When I have a shell type geometry it's quite easy to create groups but when it comes to 3D solid geometries I can't figure out a way to create an element selection (ELSET) easily. Although I have figured out some ways those are not what I need:First I created groups on Geometry (face type) then in the Mesh module Mesh > Create Groups from Geometry and I could import all the groups that I have previously created on my Geometry. Unfortunately this is not what I need because these are shell elements.Secondly Mesh > Create Groups > Face > Group on Geometry and I select one of my groups on the geometry and I end up with the same.Finally there is a way: Mesh > Create Groups > Volume > Standalone groups > Manual selection and I select all the elements that I need on the face. But the problem is that this is a manual selection which easy when one has simple geometry like a cube or something but when it's a complex geometry with e.g. 500 elements on the face it's quite annoying to create this group. So my question is: Is there a way to create an element selection easily? I am sending a picture with this message.Also there is a keyword in CalculiX called *SURFACE which needs the element face numbers selected for example for hexahedral elements:Face 1: 1-2-3-4Face 2: 5-8-7-6Face 3: 1-5-6-2Face 4: 2-6-7-3Face 5: 3-7-8-4Face 6: 4-8-5-1Does anyone know a way to create a selection for a large number of elements on a face instead of  manually typing and looking up the face element numbers?Thank you in advance!Gabor",
                "It's not clear what elements you need to have in your groups. From one of images I guess that you need to find volumes adjacent to a geom face. There are two ways:1) Mesh > Create Groups > Volume >Group On Filter. Filtering criterion = Lying on Geom, Threshold = a geom face.2) in v7.6.0. Mesh > Group Based on nodes of other groups. By using this way you can choose nb of nodes a volume has common with a group of mesh faces.St.Michael",

And my question: Is it possible to create such group in salome which includes the surfaces of elements. I'm sending a picture again if I was not clear. Again I need to create such selection for a large number of elements on the face, otherwise I can do it manually.Thank you in advance!Gabor",

However, I can not always be able to re-load and see the geometry and mesh built before!My extremely fundamental question (only asked by Salome beginner) is: Can you confirm the following steps I have done are pertinent or not?- I start Salome, choose new study and active GEOMETRY- I create a cylinder, for example- Then, MESH is activated to build mesh for the very cylinder (by Netgen 1D-2D-3D, for a sake of clarity)- Finally, I do FILE/SAVE in a .hdf file.When I want to re-use the geometry and the mesh created, I start Salome and do FILE/OPEN and choose the mentioned .hdf file.

            "discussion": [
                "Dear all,After some simulations I found a specific area of the mesh to be particularly interesting and challenging. Thus a different mesh (finer, other cells, etc.) at that point would be highly preferable. Construction of the mesh has taken quite some time (several days until a really good overall mesh was reached) due to definitions on many different faces/edges. In order to avoid redoing all that stuff and for just improving the mesh at this area, I was thinking of the following:Is it possible to define a partition or a subshape of a geometrical compound AFTER the meshing has been done? Then I could produce a Submesh on this subshape, refining the mesh in that very region without problems. So far I always did have to redo the complete definition of the submeshes when changing something within the geometry...Does anybody have other ideas how to deal with the problem at hand?How would it work to define a new group based on a simple geometrical form in which then I could do some splitting and cell manipulation?Thanks for any answers in advance!Best Regards,Bernhard",
                "Hello Bernhard,I don't understand exactly what you want to do.Yes, you can define subshapes on a geometry (using theExplode toolorCreate Grouptool) after creating a mesh on it, and then create a new submesh in your already existing mesh.But if want to change the shape of your geometry (eg. making a partition), so you will have a new object and then you will have to create a new void mesh on it, and to define again all subgeometries and submeshes.To do it I implemented some tools in thecfdmshlibrary. Using them you can quiet quickly copy geometrical groups from a shape to another, and also copy a mesh definition from one mesh to another. There are all the same some conditions of use : all meshing parameters should have a different name.You can download cfdmsh from this page (look for cfdmsh 2.2):http://www.vzlu.cz/en/results-transfer/software-r/free-software-downloadThere are mini-tutorials in the documentation explaining how to do it.Hope you find this useful.Best regards,William",
                "Dear William,Thank you for your answer! For clarification, please find attached a small image. There is a clipping of the mesh I use. The gray area I would like to refine/modify meshwise.The problem for the moment is: The subshape is not yet part of the geometry, so I have to create it first. At this point I do not see how I could add the group/subshape concerned to the geometry without having to redo everything of the mesh creation, beginning with defining all of the mesh parts.I definitely will have a look at cfdmsh! Maybe that is exactly what I am looking for.Or is there a way of merging two different meshes within a compound? Then I first would create the second part, define the mesh on this one and then merge the meshes within the compound. My first trials at this approach caused the two meshes to be quite intersected and completely apart from each other. The \"merge coincident elements\" option of compound construction did not combine the different meshes...Best Regards,Bernhard",
                "Update: So far I had a very quick try on cfdmsh2.2. At the moment it exports \"only\" 4 submesh definitions, but I will have to try later again! That already could save a lot of time if it worked!Thank you for the moment!Cheers,Bernhard"

I developed my mesh converter from Salome to our solver and there is no recognized difference between a mesh in CGNS format and a mesh from my converter. I have also sometimes imported CGNS meshes into Salome and used them as meshes generated into Salome.I think the only one difference between mesh formats is what they can do (for example, UNV does not support pyramids). But when they do something, so they all are similarly precise.Best regards,William",

The mesh contains no geometric associativity.  It has tetrahedral and triangular linear elements and all the nodes.  Nothing more.  It came from a CodeAster *.med file.2. I would like to create groups of triangular elements, so that I can apply constraints for a solver (CodeAster).3. I want only the triangular elements on a particular face, not any others that lie on other faces/planes.4. I have tried two ways:A. Using a rectangular selection box that encompasses the entire face, when the face is perpendicular to my line of sight.B. Using a rectangular selection box that encompasses the edge of the face, when the face is in-line with my line of sight.Both these are illustrated in the left and right pictures attached below.  Neither method gives satisfactory results.  Invariably, other face elements get selected (which I don't want, in method A.) or many elements beyond a seemingly arbitrary depth never get selected (in method B).I am aware that one can subsequently, edit the group to fine tune (add / remove), but in a complex model (even with a very fast multi-core PC with an ultra fast graphics display card) that process is unacceptably slow.  I am looking for a feature that is relatively common and straight forward in commercial pre-processors.  Please don't tell me that I should therefore use commercial software.  Salome is a very well written package, with lots of features and put together by very hard working people whose coding skills are far beyond my capabilities!  I only ask as a modest user, looking to learn or in turn ask for help or improvements to the software.  Thank you for any assistance that anyone can provide.Regards,JMB",

Is there a possibility in general to \"trap\" the result of such a command (and maybe others) and to use it as a boolean value to decide what has to be done for next loop in intersection seeking process?I would be very grateful for a short reply on that since my tries of programming functions for calculating iteratively any intersections slow down the whole building process very much.Kind regards,Thore OltersdorfPhD Student at Fraunhofer ISE, Germany",

I not sure.... in any case, your only problem right now is to do it with r = 0.003 and for that try what i mentioned about the scaling up and then down.best regards.Previously Said ÇATALBAŞ wrote:Hi Franco,First of all, thanks a lot for your kind replies. Unfortunately I have to keep porosity this level so I can not make changes at sphere radius. But the 3 issue is not about salome, it way my fault I think because the coordinates are not go through the cylinder. I mean the coordinates are already inside the cylinder. But the image (issue_3) probably is a visualiation error because as I mentioned the resultant of X and Y coordinates are not cross the border of cylinder. I tested that with 50 speheres at near the border. In meshing module they look all inside the cylinder but when you change to the geometry module they look little bit outside the cylinder. That confuse me a lot but now I am pretty sure coordinates are inside the borders. By the way, the coordinates were created with the Monte Carlo method.I cant get the idea of your method. I have to separate the spheres according to the z-axis for some calculations, like the attached image. If I fuse them first how do I seperate them?I will try to find a solution by following your path.As you mentined this is a OF case and the meshing process will be heartbreaking but I have to do that.As a precaution, we let the spheres overlap a bit so that the solutions do not diverge because if they are not ovelap a bit,we should have used an infinitely small mesh at the intersection of the spheres.Kind regards,Said.",

                "Dear Cristian,In my sense, Salome GEOM has not such capabilities that can have FreeCAD, NaroCAD, or any other good open source CAD solutions (or commercial solutions like Catia, Soldiwork...).It is to be compared to a LSPrePost, ANSA or HyperMesh solution that offers basic CAD features to draw simple shapes, but no more.The topic you raise is similar to the topic of parametric CAD management which need a parametric solver, also a missing item in Salome but which would definitely extend its CAD capabilitires.Maybe in the future?Bests,Pierre",
                "You might want to put that in a todo list since all it would take is the implementation of a folder like feature to the object browser which is considerably easier to do in my opinion - I even implemented a simple version of that in a school project on top of an sql database in about 300 lines of code and you alredy have the basic infrastracture there from the group command . And my guess is that it shouldn't need to touch the geom module . A linear organization of how the geom module sees the project can be maintained while the object browser puts stuff in folder like subtrees . It would probably be simple and make salome usable in the design of projects that would need to make hundreds of objects possible without scrolling several linear pages in the object browser or doing some other contorted thing to manage a large project .With this presumably simple change I guess Salome could be used as a real geometric design tool instead of being just a tool to import stuff from other existing or developing CAD tools for use in FEM/FEA projects . Also your project tries to be more commercial then open source community friendly so mabe some of your commercial customers would appreciate such a feature .",

But I have to \"click\" on each element (nodes and lines) that I've generate in the first module to know ID numbers of each in order to create a group (create a group of  nodes and lines)Can I generate a python script which can use automatically ID numbers fro creating groups?I'm sorry for my english!If you want, I can send you the .py file which I've generated so far.Thank you in advance!!Pietro",
                "Hello,I am not sure at 100% to understand what you want to doIf you have several modules that you want to put in a single object (structure) and then create a group from each of them, so you can use thegeompy.GetInPlace()function which allows to do it without need of knowing IDs of sub-shapes.Enclosed is a example.Best regards,William",

                "Hello Pietro,I think the best way is to avoid the use of IDs and to use thegeompy.GetInPlace()function. This function allows to take any object and to say \"I want a group corresponding to this object\".So, by putting points in a list, it is possible to say for each of them \"I want a group containing this node\". To create a group with several nodes, you can put them in aCompoundand create a group from it.To put all sub-shapes in a group, like theFramegroup in your case, you can get IDs usinggeompy.SubShapeAllIDs().I modified your script to use these functions. Please, have a look at it. I think it does exactly the same as before, but ignoring IDs.I also disable some code lines, like ones being not compatible with the standalone version of Salome (not Salome-Meca), other publishing points and lines, or those trying to save the study.Best regards,William",

First of all (after having creating points and lines) I create 3 compounds: one for loading nodes, one for support nodes and the last one for lines; is it right?2. The next step in about creating the \"Fix\" element: why it belongs to Compound_1? Compound_1 represents lines group, isn't it? Is Compound_1 equats to group?3. I have the same question for \"Load\" and \"Loadtot\" and \"Carsempl\". Why do you add those elements to Compound_1 which represents to a group of lines?4.

                "Hello Pietro,You script works very well, and I don't see any mistake in it (even if I didn't check each line...).You must differentiate two things:GroupsandCompounds.Compoundsare assemblies of any shape, be it solid, shell, face, etc.Groupsare groups of sub-shapes of a same dimension associated to a main shape (for example, a Compound). They are usually used to define boundary conditions or local mesh parameters (through sub-meshes).In your script,Compound_1is the compound containing your whole structure. This is your main object in which everything is present (segments, but also fixed node, nodes with load, etc.). Your mesh has to be associated to this object (as you did withMesh_1 = smesh.Mesh(Compound_1)).Then, groups are created on this compound: one for the fixed node, one for each node with load, etc. You can then copy these groups into the mesh (as you did with, for example:Fix_1 = Mesh_1.GroupOnGeom(Fix,'Fix',SMESH.NODE)).Best regards,William",

The problem is that I work with little parts normally, and it is more comfortable for me to work with edges dimensioned the same way that in my cad.More: to set a precision of 10^e-6 on an edge with lenght of 0.001 is not the same than to set a precision of 10^e-6 on an edge with lenght of 1.Now I have solved in this way: every time that I import a model, I scale it with a factor 0f 1000:1 as very first operation, but Iwolud be more happy to work with mm directly.",

Your CAD-System handles the model values as [meter] and it saves 100mm as \"0.1\"[without unit (and that's the point !)]. Finally Salome imports this value(\"0.1\") commentless.Up scale your model in CAD and an import (of \"100\") would be more precisely.Or write a (python) script which scales the values inside the data-file(like .step or .stl). That would be 100% accurate and fits for export purposes to.Regards, Robert",

When I was using Salome V3 and V4, things were ok: dimension of 100 (mm) in the CAD application was imported as dimension = 100 (adimensional) in Salome.Things are changed in Salome V5, because the cad is always the same (Solid Edge V18), and, as you say, dimension of 100 (mm) in the cad application is imported as 0.1 (adimensional) in Salome.So it seems that there is not an import option to setup in Salome, about this matter?",

I tried using something like this below but it creates a new part rather than continuing from last feature.fromsalome.shaperimportmodelmodel.begin()partSet=model.moduleDocument()Part_1=model.addPart(partSet)Part_1_doc=Part_1.document()2- How do I get selection by mouse into python console to create groups of faces? It seems real hard to try to find IDs of individual elements(the name is very long with complex syntax). I just want to box select things and get them in python command argument.3- Sometimes there are application errors,when they appear. only option is to kill salome. Is there a way to trackback what is the problem without losing the current session?4- How do I box select geometry for groups in such a way that only foreground geometry is selected. The hidden faces should not get selected.5- When there are lot of parts to display, the operations such as rotation and zoom are rather slow. However the same geometry when exported and viewed in geometry module rotates and spins without lag.Is there a way to automatically update exported geometry in GEOM module and consequent meshes in meshes module? Right now, it seems we need to export the changed geometry each time and create new meshes over it.Thanks a lot.Anirudh",

Instead of using addPart, you can get the part and its doc like this:from ModelAPI import *model.begin()partSet = model.moduleDocument()aPart = objectToFeature(partSet.object(\"Features\", 0))aPartResult = modelAPI_ResultPart(aPart.results()[0])Part_1_doc = aPartResult.partDoc()Then you can add features like this:Box_1 = model.addBox(Part_1_doc, 10, 10, 10)I got those lines from the SHAPER sources: src/ModelAPI/Test/TestSaveOpen2.py2. Some features accept other feature's result as \"all-in-\" prefix. For instance:model.selection(\"COMPOUND\", \"all-in-Box_1\")But it does not work for groups.You can also use the alternative mode of selection by coordinates. See the dump_geo.py file created by the dump feature. In the menu Part/Dump instead of File/Dump study.For instance to select a point by naming:model.selection(\"VERTEX\", \"[Box_4_1/Front][Box_4_1/Right][Box_4_1/Top]\")or by its coordinates:model.selection(\"VERTEX\", (10, 10, 10))3. Sometimes the dialog box with application errors is just behind the Salome window. You can close it.If you find some sigsegv or crashes, please try to send the steps to reproduce them.4. It is not yet possible. Maybe available in next version.5. You can disable some selection modes (Vertices, Edges, Faces) by right-click in the view or in the preferences of SHAPER, in the Viewer tab.6. It is not yet possible.

                "Hello,I am using salome 740 to create a 2D mesh for an Openfoam simulation. As you most surely know, 2D simulation in openfoam use a 3D mesh and the \"third\" direction has one cell width.I haven't used the \"traditional\" approach (mesh: 3D extrusion, sub-meshes: 2D mesh front face, 2D projection to the back, 1D elements in the third direction).Instead I used a compound shape for a face, to create a more complicated mesh in sub-meshes, in sub-shapes of the face. This resulted in a strictly 2D mesh, created on a \"compound\" geometry.How can I extrude this strlictly 2D mesh to a 3D mesh with on cell width in the third direction, to import it to Openfoam?I tried to \"extrude\" the mesh (successfully I think), but the \"create boundary elements\" utility didn't work.I tried also to copy and paste the 2D mesh in a new 3D mesh, but the \"import 1d 2d elements from another mesh\" asks for a source-face and doesn't accept the compound face on which all the mesh was built.Any ideas?Arsenis",
                "Hi ArsenisI think your approach is better than 3D geometry etc.I tried to \"extrude\" the mesh (successfully I think), but the \"create boundary elements\" utility didn't work.What was wrong with \"create boundary elements\"?I suppose \"create boundary elements\" is not needed at all since \"Extrusion\" creates boundary 1D and 2D elements in addition to 3D elements.St.Michael",
                "Thank you for your interest and your time!After the extrusion to a distance (0 1 0), the utility \"create boundary elements\" replies that \"0 boundary elements have been added\".  In my case extrusion hasn't produced any group of boundary elements.I also tried to create a mesh with the \"3D geometry etc\" way with a little more success. The new mesh uses the compound mesh for the front and etc etc, the only problem is the error \"No nodes found above node 53642\". Is there any threshold to the size of the mesh or is it caused by other reasons?Any ideas?",
                "It is strange to me that you did not succeed. It worked like a charm for me just recently...One of the important things: You will have to create the groups for the 2D-Mesh before the extrusion! If I remember correctly, afterwards I had the different groups (i.e. boundary elements) afterwards with a name extension \"extruded\".You might also try to extrude the meshed group of the 2D surface instead of the mesh.I will check again how I did this, unfortunately I am on another computer at the moment...",
                "Bernhard is right.To get groups of boundary faces, before Extrusion you have to create groups of mesh edges that will be extruded into groups of faces and a group of faces that will be extruded into a group of \"top\" faces.St.Michael",

The 1D edge elements will become 2D shape elements and the 2D for shape will become 3D for volume. Delete the edge and volume boundaries and export the mesh.A last (I hope) problem: when I use ideasUnvToFoam to convert to Openfoam mesh, there is an error \"Found 40 undefined faces in mesh; adding to default patch\"Is it by any  chance a well-known error, a problem of the described process or anything else?Thank you very much,Arsenis",

(Sometimes increasing tolerance geompy.LimitTolerance() maybe necessary before Partition).In the case if nodes of the mesh domains are almost coincident, it's possible to heal the mesh by applying mesh.MergeNodes( mesh.FindCoincidentNodes( 1e-3) ), instead of partitioning the geometry model.St.Michael",

When i export the unv file openfoam does not like all the extra groups. so i first delete the edge and volume group.

                "Thank you for your reply,#1. after a closer look I think that the drawing is not a visualization bug because when I export the mesh I see the same flame like drawing in other programs too. For example in gmsh I get the same image when I export the problematic mesh as you can see from the image.#2. I managed to solve the problem but it took me a while to understand why it was producing errors. If I remove the line that assigns the lengthnearvertex I miss it from the next line which assigns it to other edges. I think Salome has a bug that creates a submesh on vertex out of the blue. Also the line NETGEN_Parameters_2D.SetLocalSizeOnShape is not dumped in any of the cases I assingned it. I had to add it manually at my scripts.Generally I found that the free faces and the facezones are being created because the unv file is not created correctly. But not because of a bug in the file writing but in netgen. Suppose that there is an edge with length L. And suppose that netgen has a min size S1 and a max size S2. If L>S2 then everything is ok. If S1<L<S2 then netgen is not being correct at the edge L and it creates skewed triangles. At that point it creates a mesh but it seems to get stuck at some optimization stage. So it produces errors in the python console but you see a mesh in Salome which is not optimized. This mesh is creating the flame like shapes and since it is incomplete it has problems. It looks erratic with skewed faces and it produces the free faces and the facezones yet Salome thinks that it is ok and saves it. But it is a bad mesh and it creates problems.When I changed the geometry and created new edge groups and hypotheses so that L>S2 then everything completed smoothly and the problems went away.Perhaps a fail safe hypothesis could be added so that it checks the length of an edge and if L<S2 then netgen automatically could switch to a different S2 on that edge like S2=1/5*L or something like that.",
                "netgen is not being correct at the edge L and it creates skewed triangles.At least in the attached script the edges are meshed by Regular_1D + LengthNearVertex and not by NETGEN, which is not guilty in this case I think.St.Michael",

Create a submesh on big_edges front with 1D. max size 0.04 - 0D:size near vertex 0.0026. Create the mesh and it is ok (see forum1.jpg)7. I dump the study8. I reload the previously saved study and I get the same mesh but with a submesh on vertex (g2.py)9. Also when I check the algorithms some are not shown in the submesh options. For example when I go to netgen options the local_size algo is not shown.10 Unfortunately I don't keep track of previous efforts so I can't seem to replicate the lost algorithms. I will try to remember the steps that made some algorithms getting lost and I will report back.Also I would like to ask: In the second image you can see an area that is close to a geometrical object.

That would add lots of checks in the geometry creation and it Would make the models run slowly. I thought that perhaps there could be a \"proximity\" check and if a geometry (vertex or line) is too close to another geometry (to another vertex or line) extra points could be added automatically by netgen. This is done partially when you set the fineness but I don't know if you can add more fineness in a cloud like way around vertices."

To workaround this weakness of NETGEN, you can use Triangle(Mefisto) algorithm to mesh the bottom of Film.A more simple solution is to use Projection 1D-2D instead of Projection 2D, but in this case your specific 1D mesh (table density) is lost on the top and bottom.St.Michael.",

                "Hello Salome community,I use openFOAM, and have been looking around for an alternative to the built-in snappyHexMesh utility to help me in my projects. Using the introductory tutorials that I have found on your site as well as around the internet, I have learned how to make a mesh from built-in CAD tools, as well as step boundaries; however, these do not help me because my boundaries are 3d (.stl files) components themselves.When I want to mesh the fluid region contained within the components, Salome meshes the solid components themselves instead of the region contained within, and that's not what I'm looking for.Even more so, the mesh is not uniform, because it seems to think the lines of the stl file are mesh refinement zones. Although I think that's an interesting way of designating refinement zones, it's not my current objective. I could very well be asking something that Salome is not prepared to do, so I ask you to please enlighten me if that is the case.I have just started learning different CAD/CAE programs, and as such, I don't have a solid workflow yet. I'm willing to learn how to use different CAD/CAE programs to get what I want done. One caveat: I want to continue using OpenFOAM.My colleague is the solidworks guy, and has been generous in working with me to determine the best way of doing our work. Right now, he sends me stl files of the parts, I make sure they are watertight using Sketchup, and then set up the meshing utility in OpenFOAM to take care of the rest. The reason I say that he is available to help is that if it would make my life easier, he could give me a step file, or some other CAD format. That way, I am not constrained by a CAD file type.I look forward to any and everyone's opinion, and please don't hesitate to ask if I can make my question any clearer.",

It is annoying because I use Salome for mesh generation from script in loop. Then after finishing the loop I end up having a lot of python terminal windows.I am using Salome 9.2.2 on Windows. This issue never appeared on Salome 8.3 and previous versions.Is there a way to fix this?",

In particular it is the linepid = re.findall(r'Caption=.*omniNames.*\\n?CommandLine=.*omniNames.*\\D%s\\D.*\\n?ProcessId=(\\d*)'%(port),allProc)[0]which fails. Maybe it has something to do with different way of treating strings in python 3, not sure. But I see that in Salome 8, the string allProc is treated as raw string, but in 9 it contains all escape characters (\\r\\n...). The solution that worked for me was changing the lineallProc = proc.communicate()[0]toallProc = proc.communicate()[0].decode('ascii')Would be great if someone from Salome developers could fix this in next releases."

                "HelloI am using Salome 7.4.0 on both Windows and Ubuntu.  I have studied Salome Tutorial EDF Exercise 2 which demonstrates how to create one region of a 2-d face with a coarse mesh (the region far from  the quarter circle) and another region (the region close to the quarter circle) with a fine mesh.  I have been trying to extend these ideas to a similar geometry but extruded into 3-dimensions with just a 1 cell thickness in the z direction (3rd dimension).   Does anyone know of a simple tutorial or example that shows how to do this?    I have tried creating the same 2-d shapes as in Exercise 2 and extruding them into the 3rd dimension; then creating a group of all the edges that extend into the 3 rd dimension, and trying to create a submesh of these edges, using Wire Discretization, No. divisions = 1.  But when the mesh is computed, this always conflicts with the previously defined submesh for the making of a finer mesh on the inner quarter circle.  I can provide details, but if anyone can point me to a successful 3d meshing involving regions of differing fineness but only 1 cell thick in the 3rd dimension, that would be very much appreciated.Thank you.Richard",
                "Hi RichardFor me, the simplest way to get an 1 cell thick mesh is to Extrude 2D mesh right in Mesh module. To get groups of 3D cells it's necessary to create corresponding 2D groups before extrusion, then these 2D groups will be extruded into 3D ones.The way you try to create 3D mesh is correct. If you share your study (hdf file) that does not work, I can explaine why it does not work.St.Michael",
                "Hello St. MichaelThank you for your response.I have attached two files that show the problems I have had.In the first -- TwoRectangles.hdf -- I created a simple square face, then used Partition to create two faces, one small, one big.  Then I used Extrusion to extrude into the Z direction which created two solids.  I also created a Group on the Partition consisting of all the vertical (z direction) edges.   In the Mesh module, I created Mesh_1 for the Partition as the Geometry with 3D Extrusion, 2D: Quadrangle mapping, and 1D: Wire discretization No segments=10.  Then I created SubMesh_1 on Mesh_1 for the Geometry of just the small solid with the same scheme, except for 1D: Wire disc. No. segments=15.  Finally, I created SubMesh_2 on Mesh_1 for the Geometry of the Group of Z edges, 1D: Wire disc. No. segments=1.   When I applied this, I got a message box about a conflict with SubMesh_1 and SubMesh_2 and asking for the order in which to apply them.  I left it as SMesh_1, SMesh_2.   You will see from the resulting mesh in the viewer that the meshing in the Z direction is more than 1 cell thick.In the second--SalomeEx_2_3D, I have recreated the EDF example 2, with a fine mesh in the inner quarter circular area, and a coarser mesh outside it.  I have created an extrusion into the Z direction in geometry, but now perhaps you can show me how to project those meshes in to that direction with just 1 cell thickness.   I have not been able to succeed at that.Of course, if you need any other information, please ask.Oh, I had to compress the two files since each is >100kB.  I compressed them to zip files.  If you have any problem extracting them, please let me know what format would be best to use.  I used the archiver, 7-zip.Your help is greatly appreciated, thank you.Richard",

In my previous post I meant Extrusion operation available in menu Modification > Extrusion. In a picture below there is a preview of Mesh_1, which is 2D, extruded using this operation.St.Michael",
                "Hi St. MichaelI downloaded v. 7.5.1, and tried it with the TwoRectangles file;  it does indeed mesh without errors and as expected.And thank you for showing me the meshing extrusion algorithm in Modifications -->  Extrusion.  This will be a very useful tool I think.Thanks very much for your time and help!Richard"

                "Hello,I am trying to create a face using a wire.  The wire is constructed of three arcs forming a closed loop.  However Salome 6.3.1 reports an error \"There is no closed contour can be built from given arguments\", when I try to use the 3 arcs (Arc_2, Arc_4 & Arc_5), or the other three arcs.  The script illustrating the problem is attached.  It is a simplified version of a geometry that represents the weld beads when two rods (represented by Circle1 & Circle2) are to be joined together.I need to create an extrusion representing the weld bead later to be boolean fused with the two rods.  One might suggest that I could create the figure \"8\" like face that depicts the two rods and the 2 weld beads all as a single entity, rather than just these two triangular wedges that I intend extruding.  My actual model of the two rods is more complicated (and because of other limitations & bugs in Salome reported earlier) I am forced to take the approach I am taking.The same script causes Salome 6.3.0 to fail miserably much earler (in the creation of Arc_3) !!!  I don't think that version is worthy of a release yet, especially when such simple geometry creation is so broken!  Hope somebody can suggest a way out of this situation.Regards,JMB==========================================================================================================================================# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-###### This

For example, section 1 in the partition might have shell normals facing radially away from the X-axis while section 2 of the partition has normals facing the X-axis. This is causing me all kinds of problems when I apply heat flux in CalculiX because the heating on the surface looks like a checker board.Is there a way to unify the mesh such that all the adjacent shell elements have a common normal vector?

For instance:Clipping plane #1:- distance 0.6Clipping plane #2:- distance 0.6First rotation: 180 (to invert the normal to the plane)If it doesn't fit your needs, you can use Paraviz and combine the 2 following filters: 3d glyphs and slice. You may have to apply first the filter Cell data to point data if your field is on cells, since Paraviz can create glyphs only on field on nodes.Christophe",

Playing with the distances to be close to 0.5, you can reduce the box to a kind of plan. Hence visualise the values on this plane.Using Paraviz and the slice filter, you will be able to define the exact plane and visualise the values of the nodes which lie exactly on this plane.",

Bad user!So maybe what you can do, it's to wrap your code in theexecutableway with the YACSGEN tool provided into SALOME 5.1.4 (The documentation of this tool is in the YACS documentation).For the FORTRAN bug, honestly I don't know, it seems that the container receives an exception from your code in the printf...What maybe happens is that if you have two methods in your FORTRAN code mapped in two services, they are maybeexecuted in parallel -> and FORTRAN codes are often not reentrant.Next time, could please send to us your SALOME session and YACS logs and your YACS schema ?André",

I imported a STEP model (a marine propeller), I scaled to 1000:1 because of the [mm] 'bug' of Salome and slightly rotated. Then I builded a fifth of cylinder to cut the model (and I need the wedge later to create a tet mesh for the fluid domain around the propeller, with another cut operation). I also generated some planes to partition the blade, so I can fuse the derived solids in one single solid with more faces. Here is my problem: I can't partition the blade. I tried to apply Repair operations likeShape ProcessingorLimit Tolerance, but I failed. Can anyone try that? I'm not expert, maybe there are simple tricks in 'tuning' the shape repair process, but I don't know themThanks for your attention and your time.",
                "No expert in the field, but I came across a similar problem recently. Seemingly impossible to use the partitioning unless \"wire\" is selected as the resulting shape. Is this so because the solid actually contains shells only (it does!); then, cutting it by a plane produces wires?? It should, furthermore, be possible to generate a solid from the shells; but that seems not to work. Question to the developers: Is there a reason for this behavior or do I misinterpret something?? Is this inherited somehow from the step file format?\n\nBest, B.",

Script error reported in the previous post2. This is not the first propeller/blade I work on, but never had this hard problem with Partition operations. Anyway, I always followed another procedure to 're-face' the blade: partitioning solid blade/propeller by planes to obtain more solids (not faces subshapes, fusing all solids to obtain one single solid. Do you think your 'face subfaces' way is always more efficient and maybe less resources consuming?3 About your script, I'm surprised by face indexing, for example. How can you know a priori the index associated with a certain face (or edge or whatever)? In other words, Salome always uses the same criteria and I can apply the same script to different, for instance, propeller geometries?",

I am very surprised that partition does not work with the hole shape while it works with extracted sub-shapes affected by partition; moreover the boolean operations also works OK with the whole shape. It's a pure bug of partition.> How can you know a priori the index associated with a certain faceNo way to know indices of sub-shapes a priory. A right way to get a specific sub-shape is to use functions selecting sub-shapes by some criteria (one can find them in geompyDC.py) like GetShapesOn*(),  GetFaceNearPoint(), etc.In my case, where a geometry is imported and I need not to create a generic solution, I used Create Group dialog to find out  indices of blade faces; I selected the 2 faces in the viewer, clicked \"Add\" button and saw indices in the dialog.BR, SM"

Everywhere there are regular block/cubes so, I should not have problem with generating all Hex elements, whether I use Local length or Max_size for 1D.However, for the partition named 'bc3_prep' and 'gnt_prep' and somewhat for 'bc5_prep', there are errors using Max_Size. but no errors using Local_length.Even generating a default mesh over 'bc3_prep' using these parameters: Hexa (i,j,k)for 3D, Quadrangle for 2D, Max_Size for 1D(with propagation of nodes to opposite edges) causes error.One other observation is that the above attempt at mesh generation succeeds if we use the default value(~0.6) that appears in Max_Size dialog box under 1D hypothesis.I generate the geometry using script and most of partition planes(named by 'all_planes_x') are created by 'multi_translated_planes' feature.

Since there is always an edge below another one, the max_size should propogate in a similar way.I also believe is that maybe the edge orientation is not maintained in Max_size, so it starts cutting edge from other side for some thus edges leaving uneven number of cubes on top and bottom side.RegardsAnirudh",

Is there a tolerance involved in multi translation, so the distance between multiple instances of multi translation varies a little from one instance to another?Also, If I enquire using \"what is\" function of Salome about a partition, it says a compound.Shouldn't a partition be CompSolid since faces are shared between the adjacent solids?Regards",

The mesh starts and runs correctly until the point which appears in the command window the script \"Optimize Face 1\". At this point the computer continues to perform its reckons and it seems to never end the calculus.Do you have any suggestions?Thanks",

After the partition, I would like to glue the two solids at the interface (where the original object was partitioned) so they can share a conforming mesh at the interface (I think).  I used Repair --> Glue Face, but found that the \"Selected Shape\" does not allow selecting more than one solid.  How do I glue the solids together?  Or, more generally, what's other way to get a shared conforming mesh at the interface?  Thanks.\n\n- ffan",
                "Hello,The glue face operation works only on a compound containing solids (to glue together).But actually, when making a partition, there is no need to glue sub-solids because they are (should) already glued together.The glue operation is usually used to avoid the use of partitions which can be time-consuming for complex geometries.Best regards,William",

                "Hi William,\n\nI did a test.  There are two bars (attached picture).  The one on the left was created in Salome with Box command.  The one on the right is an imported CAD geometry.  I use a plane to partition both bars, and then use Explode to extract the four solids.  I then use Netgen 1D-2D-3D and Netgen 3D Parameter \"Very Fine\" to mesh the back sides of both bars.  And, Netgen 1D-2D-3D and Netgen 3D Parameter \"Very Coarse\" to mesh the front sides of the bars.  Here, it shows that the mesh at the interfaces are not conforming for both bars.  I would like to know how I can get the mesh to conform at the interfaces.  Thank you.\n\n- ffan",

Then click on the suitable sub-shape (eg.Solid_3inside yourPartition_1) and put there finer parameters.(You can select several sub-shapes at a time and it will create automatically a geometrical group containing them all.)Best regards,William",

This generated Mesh_1 and Mesh_2.  Since I wanted to create different-sized meshes on Solid_1 and Solid_2, I right-clicked on Mesh_1 and selected Create Sub-mesh.  Selected Solid_1 for the geometry and set Netgen 1D-2D-3D Parameter to Very fine.  When I click Apply and Close, it said \"Geometry object is not a sub-shape of the shape to mesh.\"  (Please see the picture \"Sub-mesh.jpg\" shown in the next post.)

Let's say this 2D-cut is in the XOY coordinate plane.Then, I meshed it and I exported the result in .mesh format (let's call it \"test.mesh\") so it could be used by another calculation software (FreeFem++).For now, whereas my geometry is in 2D (it is a plane), \"test.mesh\" is in a \"3D format\", ie :- it is written \"Dimension 3\" in the header- this is the third coordinate \"z\" in the description of the vertices (here, z=0 for every vertex).For my final purpose, I need \"test.mesh\" to be in 2 dimensions. I can do this by hand (by replacing \"Dimension 3\" with \"Dimension 2\" and suppressing the third coordinate), but I am looking for a way to do this directly with Salome.Has anyone already had this issue or any idea to solve it?Thanks.Best regards,Megane",

Unfortunately, this cannot be done directly. In this case you have to apply something like the approach you use now.

                "Hi everybody,currently I am working in Prof. Behbahani's group on a CFD benchmark study released by the Food and Drug Administration USA that is related to a simplified centrifugal blood pump. The purpose of this project is to determine how computational fluid dynamics can be effectively used to characterize fluid flow and to predict blood damage in medical devices. This pump consists out of two parts, one rotor and one housing (see picture 1). The participants received CAD-files for the rotor respectively for the housing from the FDA (see CAD-files).In order to create the fluid domain I would like to make a Boolean-Cut between rotor and housing which seems not to be possible due to the fact that Salome doesn´t recognize the rotor as one volume (see picture 2).In principle the participants should work with the CAD-files from FDA, but to overcome the problem in Salome I created the rotor and the housing in Autodesk Inventor 2013 and exported them as an iges-file. Salome now recognizes the rotor as one part and i am also able to create the above mentioned fluid domain. But when I want to mesh this fluid domain the space between rotor and housing will not be filled with volume elements. The error message indicates that Salome has a problem with the more or less complex outer rotor fillets (see pictures 3, 4 and 5). I also tried to reduce the max. size of each volume element to a size that is smaller than the radii of the fillets which were not successful.Then I created this rotor again with a uniform outer rotor fillet and this worked quite well. But this is not acceptable for the benchmark study, because we have to use the original geometry.Does anybody know how to fix the problem that Salome doesn`t recognize the rotor as one part? Has Salome in principle a problem to work with such complex variable fillets?Thanks for any kind of relevant comments.Best regardsP.S. The pictures and CAD-Files are too large to attach them. Therefore you can download them here:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lrhlpk2tvlxp3gi/U3iKNGNu0_",
                "Hello SebastianI have tried your shapes on a development version of SALOME and OCCT. No problem with rotor import, it is imported as one solid. But unfortunately, rotor's geometry is of unacceptable quality for Boolean operations and other ones I tried (limit tolerance, scale). 3 couples of vertices have too high tolerances so that OCCT considers rotor as self-intersecting. I doubt OCCT will ever be able to deal with these shapes.Best regardsEdward",

                "Hi Ryusuke,I think I remember some mistake like that from my trials with ideasUnvToFoam.If I remember correctly it was due to groups which were made from solids instead of faces or something like that. I suggest trying to remove (in a copy of your file, of course) all of the groups not corresponding to boundary faces. Afterwards ideasUnvToFoam should provide you with a nice polyMesh/boundary file containing all the different faces as boundaries.Another suggestion from my side: Look for the script provided on the forum by Nicolas Edh! He wrote a great script directly exporting the mesh to a complete OpenFOAM-polyMesh folder! Even Tetraedres work, which - to my knowledge - is not the case for unv-files.Cheers,Bernhard",

After this, I create subMeshes at different parts.But I encount the creating mesh error(Radial Quadrangle meshes error for example).Is it wrong?I think I should create whole geometry and separate them in different parts (don't use \"Fuse\" command), but I have not tried yet.If not so, I think I mistake the way of creating submeshes.I think I have to study about creating meshes by using submeshes...However, I could create the similar meshes as below by using blockMeshDict in OpenFOAM.At the moment the mesh goes well and there are no troubles.But I continue to try to create the mesh by Salome from now on.Thank you very very much Bernhard!",
                "Sorry for the late reply, somehow I completely missed looking in here!What MIGHT be the problem is the fusing of the different meshes within the meshing tool.For me it usually works the following way:- In the GEOM module build the geometry as usual. In the end build a compound of the different parts of the geometry. (Compound_Geom)Do not forget to create your groups which become the boundary conditions in a later step!- In the SMESH module create a mesh without any specifications (no algorithm, no hypothesis, etc.) on the Compound_Geom.Then create the different submeshes on the parts of Compound_Geom and go forward with your meshing.Finally take over your groups on surfaces from geometry.- Run salomeToOpenFOAM.py on the new mesh and (hopefully) receive a nice mesh for OpenFoam."

                "Hello,I have Salomé 7.6.0 together with Code Aster (Package salome-meca 2015.2) installed. I want to model the water domain of a storage tank and then cut it in half to make use of symmetry in the simulation. For me it is easier to create the whole tank and then cut it in half because I will want to add some connection pipes that will also be cut in half. Cutting is done with a box that surrounds half of the tank and then boolean common to keep what is inside the box.My problem is that I get strange results depending on the shape of the tank. The tank is built with a wire that consists of two ellipital arcs for the bottom and lid of the tank and two lines to connect them. The wire is transformed to a face and then revoluted around the center axis.When I do this with the whole tank the result is not as expected: The whole tank is still there. Doing this only with the cylindrical part it works. With only the bottom part it doesn't. So it seems to be a problem with the arcs that are revoluted but I cannot find a fault.Attached is a test script. Beginning from line 54 you can switch on and off the three versions.Perhaps anyone could have a look at it and tell me what's wrong.ThanksElektrix",

I\nhave modelled the rail, a number of sleepers and a wheel with a hole\nin centre (where axle would go) in CAD and exported as STEP.I have imported the geometry into salome. I have created a face\ngroup in the lower half of the axle hole in the wheel (vertical\nloading) and solid groups for the sleepers (reactions).I plan on using the linear statics wizard, setting boundary\nconditions, degrees of freedom to 0, 0, 0 for the sleepers (to make\nthem fixed). Is this correct?Also for the loading, how do I specify boundary conditions of the\nload from the train in the axis perpendicular to the rail? Do I\nspecify a pressure on the lower half of the axle hole? I am not sure\nthis is correct as the load is purely vertical. I could redraw the\nwheel as half a solid wheel and load it with a pressure over the half\nface, but this is a bit of a work around and would like to apply the\nloading as previously mentioned...Any help greatly received!Many Thanks,Kev",

So starting with a pressure on the bottom part of the inner whole is a reasonable assumption.How do you model contact between the wheel and the track?",

Initially I had a small interference between the wheel and rail, however, could not get the mesh to compute. I introduced a small 0.5mm clearance between the two as a test and the mesh was created with success. Do you know how Code-Aster deals with this? Is it acceptable to start with a clearance and allow the analysis to 'close' it by allow a degree of freedom for the wheel in the relevant axis?As for moldelling the contract stresses, I am unsure, I had intended simply using the linear elastic wizard as part of Salome-Meca, however, am starting to think this is not adequate?Thanks,Kev",

Although this might be quite tricky since the interface is a point because of the two areas with double radii, it can be done. But switch to Code-Aster forum for this specific problem.",

I solve the problem with the tolerance of the cylindrical face.Now I am at step nb 2: creating a partition. I can do partitions but the cylindrical shape of the corners gives me a lot of headache. I tried to do it with planes model but I don,t know how to choose the points in order to make the planes that will allow me to mesh the entiree structureHope I am not to annoying,Best regards,Bogdan",
                "Hello BogdanYou are welcome with any amount of questions.It's not clear from your post what kind of problems you have with the cylindrical shapes. I meant that you would do the following steps after creating many solids.1) Invoke Partition operation, select all solids, press OK.2) Activate Mesh module, invoke \"Create mesh\", select \"Netgen 1D-2D-3D\" algorithm, press OK, invoke \"Compute\".St.Michael",
                "Finelly it worked, thanks to you.After you make the partition and you mesh it is any possibility of spliting the structure in different volumes? I need to create different bodies inside of the structure. I will need the bodies in Elmer for processing.This operation I have done it before in GMSH, in geometry > physical groups > volumes. Unfortunally GMSH is collapsing at this structure (don't know the reason) and I can't use it. Does the 'create group' command from Salome do the same?Thank for the information from aboveBogdan",

Am I wright?   But still I can't export the groups of geometry. Why?The second question is: Why if I try to export a step file of the partition (from Geom mode) in GMSH, the GMSH is not recognising the structure as a volume  It only alows me to make geometry from surfaces.",

You can see one attached graphic.We need to use this volume model for CNC with the tool edgeCAM. But until now we failed completely to load/import this volume model into this CAM-Software. We tried by passing the model through Inventor and here it was shown correctly with no visible non-standard surfaces/volumes. But also after this step the following IPT file was not usable.During this process there might occur some errors but we do not think that missing tolerance or overlapping sections/wires are the reason for this behaviour. Since we use the same geometry for meshing (snappyHexMesh) and CFD simulation (OpenFOAM) and on this way it works.We suppose there is a specific non-standard implementation either on the side of Salome or on the side of EdgeCam/Inventor which causes this error.On the painful way to get clean meshes several tools for meshing were tried and sometime here also the import/load of IGES/STEP files caused troubles. Due to this experience we suppose the mistake could be on the side of Salome. But we are totally unsure.The current version of Salome we used is 7.2.0.We have not used and collected experiences until now regarding the repair of such models. Is there anyone who can direct us or teach us shortly an efficient procedure how this problem could be handled or where we can read about possible solution strategies?Best regards and thanks in advance for any help.Thore Oltersdorf",

Algo chosen atsub-meshcreation overrides the algo specified at mesh creation.Thus you can select Scaled distribution at mesh creation and Equidistant distribution at sub-mesh creation; to get same (Equidistant) distribution on the opposite edge of quadrangle face you can use Additional Hypothesis = \"Propagation of 1D hyp. on Opposite Edges\".There are several variants in assigning algos (mesher + params) to get the same result. E.g. in the above described schema you can interchange Equidistant and Scaled distribution; alternatively you can assign both Equidistant and Scaled distribution at sub-mesh creation, hence there would be two sub-meshes.St.Michael",

To get a finer mesh in the middle, you are to define a sub-mesh on the middle face and use a hypothesis to require smaller element size.

With NETGEN mesher you can define min/max element size, how much adjacent elements differ in size (\"grading\" parameter), take into account curvature of boundary etc.St.Michael",

            "discussion": [
                "Hello everybody,Since I am on the forum, I would like to speak of a problem I have which is very specific but important for my work.It is about group creation and deletion in the Geometry module. Actually, when I create a geometrical group on an object from the GUI and if I delete this group always from the GUI, it really disappears. I mean: if I demand to display the groups of this objects in a Python script, the group is not here anymore.But if I create a group in a script with the method I saw in the documentation:geompy.CreateGroup() # Create the groupgeompy.AddObject() # Add IDs to the groupgeompy.addToStudyInFather() # Add the group to the study treeAnd then if I delete the group in the GUI, it disappears from the study tree... but still exists \"somewhere\" so that if I try to find it in a Python script I will!This is a problem because I want to develop user-friendly Python functions to be use in the Python console of Salome and dealing with groups... But if a user deletes a group created with one of my functions, then creates another group with the same name and try to use a function on it by giving its name, the function will find the old one being deleted and not the new one...If someone has an idea...Enclosed is a Python script to use on a geometrical object called \"Box_1\". Just create this \"Box_1\", then create some groups on it in the GUI. Then you can launch the script. It will add a new group with a random name, then will display the groups found in the box. You can launch it, then try to delete some handmade groups and launch it again. You will see that the deleted groups won't appear in the found group list. But if you delete \"python-created\" groups, you will see that they will always be found by the script during the following launches.This problem occurs with my 5.1.5 and 6.5.0 versions of Salome.Best regards,William",

Is this inherited somehow from the step file format?\n\nBest, B.",

Do you think your 'face subfaces' way is always more efficient and maybe less resources consuming?3 About your script, I'm surprised by face indexing, for example. How can you know a priori the index associated with a certain face (or edge or whatever)? In other words, Salome always uses the same criteria and I can apply the same script to different, for instance, propeller geometries?",

I am very surprised that partition does not work with the hole shape while it works with extracted sub-shapes affected by partition; moreover the boolean operations also works OK with the whole shape. It's a pure bug of partition.> How can you know a priori the index associated with a certain faceNo way to know indices of sub-shapes a priory. A right way to get a specific sub-shape is to use functions selecting sub-shapes by some criteria (one can find them in geompyDC.py) like GetShapesOn*(),  GetFaceNearPoint(), etc.In my case, where a geometry is imported and I need not to create a generic solution, I used Create Group dialog to find out  indices of blade faces; I selected the 2 faces in the viewer, clicked \"Add\" button and saw indices in the dialog.BR, SM"

                "Hello,as my activity in this forum shows, i am trying to generate a mesh of complex irregular geometry composed by 100s of cylinders.The generation of the geometry (compound) itself is relatively fast.  However,  as documented before, as soon i try to generate the solid with Boolean operation the code crashed or terribly slow down so at today i am still have not been able to obtain a result.Thus i feel the need to change approach, and need to explore different procedures that avoid fuse operations between the solid cylinders.A) My first hope is to find a way to extract only the external surface from a compound object. Is that possible? I was trying to use the repair tools to remove the internal wire but they are ineffective.B) elaborating what Saint Michael was suggesting me inhttp://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/151095632#458677606another option for me is  a)  generate all cylinder(solid)  b) extract the shell of  cylinder c) intersect shell with neighbour cylinders  (to remove internal surfaces) d) glue all shells together g) create solid from resulting shell.  Will this option be more stable? in this way i think i have more operation but each operation is simpler... Do you think i will gain in speed or stability?Any Idea or comment will be very well accepted.thank youfrancesco",
                "Hello, Francesco,Thinking about what said pierre_j here:http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/151095632#324568112I would say: In your structure, lots of elements have the same shape. Actually, there are two types of element shape: the one of elements being inside the structure, and the one being at its periphery (at least, I think ; I didn't check it but it seems logical to me).So, maybe you can prepare these two shapes and then copy, translate and rotate them so that they find there final position in the structure. Then, the fuse or the partition operations should work better because you won't have any intersected faces.You can even create only the external faces of your shapes, and then once positioned make a shell of all your faces and create a solid from it.Is it relevant?Best regards,William",
                "Unfortunatly the final structure i am trying to obtain is not regular. Attached is a figure of the  \"compound\" structure. To reach this point it is pretty easy and i obtain this compound in 2-3 minutes. My problem is to build a grid out of this compound and eventually to obtain some geometrical property of the solid (i.e. surface and volume which is obviously not the the simple summ of the surface of the cylinders.What i also want to point out is that now i am actually not worried of number of operation or speed, since salome' itself crashes doing the fuse operation, and thus i do not have any result independently on how long i wait. So i think first i need to find a more stable approach that uses different kind of operations or entities (not that just reduces the number of operations).\"create only the external faces of your shapes, and then \nonce positioned make a shell of all your faces and create a solid from \nit.\"  this is exactly what i am hoping to do and before coding it i was asking if working with shells is stable and reliable than using solids. ....thank your time and help...francesco",
                "Hello Francesco,I don't have the solution to the boolean operation problems, however I maybe know how to sort \"external\" and \"internal\" faces. But actually the shape of the final structure is a bit different (see the enclosed picture). Here is the strategy:1 - First, you don't need to create the cylinders (solids) but only their surface of revolution (not their disks). This is to accelerate the following operations. Or you can create solids, then explode them to get these surfaces (using theNew Entity,Explodetool).2 - Then, you create a bigpartitionof all these surfaces. If you use theOperations,Partitiontool without giving any \"tool\" object (by putting all the geometrical objects in the field called \"Objects\"), it will intersect and cut all the surfaces and put them into a compound object.3 - Then, you will need to delete the surfaces you don't want any more (the \"internal\" surfaces). To do so, you can explode your partition and make a loop in your script checking all the exploded surface areas. You can do it using theMeasures,Basic Propertiestool. Since the surfaces to remove are smaller than the one to keep, you can just set a threshold above which you keep the surface.4 - Once done, you can create a new shell (New Entity,Shell) with the surfaces you sorted out.5 - Finally, you can use theRepair,Suppress Holestool to close all the holes automatically. This will close them very properly with smooth tangential surfaces as on the enclosed picture.On the paper, it works... But I think such problems encountered with the fuse operations will also occur here.Hope this helpsWilliam",
                "Thank you William,I am currently under deadline but i will try this as soon as possible. It is exactely what i was trying to do and on paper is perfect:it covers also the hole between the cylinders (something i was planning to do with an extra sphere), and will allow me to use also cylinders with different radius (I am never satisfied..) since its automatically smooth out the steps at the cylinder intersection.Point 2-3 is the operation that i did not thought about. Point 3 give me the little constraint that i can not use very short cylinders. But this is not a problem.I obviously have to learn better the python scripting in order to do this and this may be a good thing.As you said on paper it works, in practice i am wondering if Salome is smart enough to be able to close the correct holes (point 5) in such a complex geometry ...  Lets hope for the best.I will try this and keep you updated...Meanwhile THANK YOU A LOT , i really appreciate your help.francesco",
                "I FOUND THE SOLUTION !!!!You just have to use theRepair, Limit tolerancetool!It permits to change the \"tolerance\" of the shape, which is then used during boolean operations or partitions!I tested it and it simply works!Champagne!I enclose a script building the Kelvin structure by the way we told about: create cylinder surfaces, partition them, sort out the surfaces, make a shell, close its holes, and then make a solid.And another last \"improvement\" of the script: To create the cylinders, I now create one and then copy it n times thanks to a function which makes transformations \"from a vector to another\". This permits by example to copy easily other shapes than cylinders - even if I don't know if you will find it usefull...William",

And i found that you precede me on the updates...THANK YOU A LOT FOR THE WORK...Thank you to find the \"Repair, Limit tolerance tool\"  that was the tool needed in the first place.However now i have built the surface approach and i think i will keep using it since it has no Boolean operations. ( well it has only the partition tool).I see that you :get the hole edges, their id and then you close them.*** Is ther a reason to do so?what i do (but i have few problem..) is just create a compound of the relevant surfaces, create the shell, then use directly the SuppressHoles tool, then i am ready to  make the solid ...Up to now I have been successful in creating a 5X5X4 regular Kelving cells structure(see atachment).Up to now i have 2 problems when the structure is randomized.*** a) for the randomized structure 5X5X4  the partition tool failed. ( here maybe i should try theRepair, Limit tolerancetool ...)*** b) when only two cylinders intersect in a node and the edge of the hole to be closed is really has a sharp angle thesuppress hole tools works but basicalli it creates a very very long been ... (see attachment in next post ...)I have an extra question ...to create the structure i have a loong list of operations to place the cylinders, i would like to have  these cylinders in a separate file and call this file from the main script.what i was trying is :import syssys.path.append(\"/home/francesco/WORK/3Dmodels/GRIDGenerator\")import shell1x1where shell1x1 has just the list of operations to place the cylinders...it works ir creates the cylinders, i can see the cylinders in the gui, but the main script does not see the cylinders ...***Any idea on how to do this correctly...?GREAT GREATAND THANK YOU EVERYBODY",

I noticed this problem. But maybe the use of suppressHole is not always necessary. Maybe you can close the holes just by creating faces from the \"hole wires\" that you can get in a script using the geompy.GetFreeBoundary() function (like in my script). The faces won't be tangential, and maybe not always very pretty, but I think it will be better than on your picture\"i can see the cylinders in the gui, but the main script does not see the cylinders ...\"Maybe you could enclose a script example (main script + script to import)...

When I imported the mesh back to Salome it worked fine and the mesh was ok.However when exporting to .unv from GUI it also took a longer time but the file was ok.With both exporting to .unv and to .med using python in the script, it took a long time, but eventually the exported meshes were ok.For this test I used a simpler model. Generating the mesh succeeds without any errors and 5 element volume groups of parts are created by filtering. This also works fine.

(see problem below)I also attempted to set the paths inside the VS Code application, under the Python interpreter settings @ext:ms-python.python; setting python.autoComplete.ExtraPaths .However, I have the following problems:1) the VS Terminal does not recognize the \"call\" command, but send the message: \"the Term 'call' is not recognized ....2) I get pylint errors for all imports of any module as follows: \"No name 'geom' in module 'salome' pylint(no-name-in-moduel) [30,5]\" , etc.3) I cannot find any set_env.bat file in any of the Salome installation directories. (Is this because I did not cmake my installation, but instead installed from the Salome-9.5.0.exe file?)Please  help direct me to enable autocompletion in some sort of python development environmont.(I'm more competent than these questions might appear, but self taught on both Salome and python.)Thank you again for your time.Vector H.",
                "Thank you for your time.I believe I have solved my problem.On Windows, with a .py script open in Visual Studio Code, choose Terminal > New(This opens a powershell window)In the powershell window, type:cd <SalomeRootDir>    (enter)start env_launch.bat    (enter)where <SalomeRootDir> is the the directory on windows that contains the W64 directory, for example c:\\Salome\\Salome-9.5.0Now autocompletion will work.Note that there are three changes from the expert post above:a) the powershell command is \"start\" not \"call\"b) the batch file set_env no longer seems to exist, so one simply runs the env_launch.bat filec) the env_launch.bat file only exists in the installation directory, not in each product directory (eg GEOM, SHAPER, etc.)I hope this is helpful.PS, to switch the Terminal window to classic command syntax, one may type cmd and press enter, to swich it back to powershell mode, type powershell and press enter.",

(It could be that VS Code simply cannot resolve all those vitual python packages, but only stores the first one it encounters)I'm guessing from Nabil's earlier post that each module subdirectory was one time the home for an env_launch.bat file, in which case his instruction might have made sense to point the paths to the __init__.py needed by the module one is working on. However, since there now seems to be only one env_launch.bat (and no set_env.bat), this method won't workI hope that's clear and my sincerity in seeking an answer comes through.Again, we are looking for a way to use VS Code to have auto-completion and error checking while working on Salome plugin scripts, but the environment setup is not allowing us to find a library that will do both \"import salome\" and \"import geom\" and \"from salome.geom import  geomBuilder\"Thank you for your time.",

            "discussion": [
                "Hello,\n\nI would like to use SALOME as platform for CFD solver based on block-structured grid. As far as I could understand, for reading structured grid written in *.med file the GRID class from med library should be used. That is more or less, clear. But the thing that bothering me the most is how to store the information in *.med file that my mesh is structured?! \n\nFor example, I created the 0-grid structured mesh (it looks structured) for pipe with partition method in geometry module, create 5 Solids (Blocks), and Groups of faces - INLET, OUTLET and PIPE_WALL. I added all this groups later in the MESH module. Enclosed you'll find the results. But when I export the mesh it's written in unstructured way. Are there any way to designate my Groups of volumes as blocks in mesh module?\n\nI think that solution to my problem lies in HEXABLOCK module, but I'm facing with couple of problems. Very often I've could the message SIG SEGV violation error 8 ... I read that might be a problem with graphic card. I'm using  OpenSuSe 11.3 with nvidia GeForce gt 440. And lack of documentation for this module is also present. If I understand well, and if we stick to the example of pipe O grid, the geometry should be created in Geometry module (just a Cylinder) and informations about the blocks in HEXABLOCK module. Am I right?\n\nI would be grateful if you share your experiences with HEXABLOCK module, and block-structured grids in SALOME. \n\nThank you very much for your answers,\nAleksandar.\n\nPS. SALOME is really outstanding piece of software!",
                "HelloSMESH is unable to write a structured grid.Med format can be used to store block-structured meshes. Though only one block can be stored in one mesh, but one file can include several structured meshes and connection between meshes also can be stored.HEXABLOCK is intended to generation of the block-structured mesh, but I don't know if it is able to store it as a block-structured mesh in any format.Currently SMESH supports CGNS format which could be used to store block-structured meshes. But someone should invest in the development.Regards",
                "Hello,\n\nThank you very much indeed for your answers! So it means that I can't use SALOME MESH module for to store information about structured mesh? I didn't understand precisely about generation of several mesh in one file - it means that every block should be meshed separately, and then export all these meshes together into one *.med file? I've tried with simple example, rectangular channel with two blocks, create separate meshes on each block, and the exported to *med. Then I tried to read this mesh using GRID class. And I've got the same message:\n\n\nMED Exception in /dn46/SALOME/series6x631/MED/Debian60-64/MED_SRC/src/MEDMEM/MEDMEM_MedMeshDriver.cxx [268] : MED_MESH_RDONLY_DRIVER::read() : Mesh type mismatch. Class MESH must be used for an unstructured mesh\n\n\nHere is the the most simplest example - channel, with one block. I defined edges in x,y and z direction in, and designate the numbers of the division in each direction. But message remains the same.\n\nSo just to make this clear\n\n>> Med format can be used to store block-structured meshes. \n\nbut SMESH can't store in that format? Right or wrong?\n\nAbout CGNS format - is it possible to use it with current version of Salome (6.3.1)? Are there any additional libraries in that sense? Conversion from cgns to med and vice versa? Hopefully it's  going to be available in next versions. \n\nAnd I'm sorry if this message is going to be without formating, like the previous one. I made a lot of paragraphs and empty spaces during typing.\n\nRegards,\nAlekdandar.",
                "In short, SALOME is not ready so far to do with block-structured grids. SMESH can generate such grids but can save them as unstructured only, never as structured in any format, neither in CGNS format.My ideas about med format to store the block-structured grid are just the reflection, not a reality of SALOME, maybe it's future, who knows.Best regards"

However, I have one more question concerning the computational issue. If you look into the image attached, you can find two meshes: one (previous) mesh without cutting and with Triangle (Mefisto) and the other with cutting and Netgen 2D for 2D algorithm. For the Netgen 2D, one can see some regions where the fine meshing has been performed (many nodes (elements) around small area). This has been avoided in the Triangle (Mefisto) and the resulting mesh looked quite fine.My question is, will this (fine meshing in certain region) cause any problem on the computation, with respect to time?Also, I have some other meshes which are to be connected to this resulting mesh. Netgen 2D has already produced strange mesh (fine meshing in some regions), Do you think operation partition for the mesh to be connected will solve the problem and make every meshes compatible (nodes connected) to each other?Thank you for every single support.

A solution is to split wires of the top and bottom into equal number of edges (3 is minimum).For that:- create 3 vertices: 1 vertex on a long edge of spherical face and 2 ones on a sole edge of planar face. There is a mode of vertex construction - by parameter on edge, convenient for creation of these vertices.- split edges of the cylinder by the 3 new vertices, use Partition with the cylinder and vertices as objects.- the rest, as usual.Don't use \"Composite Side Discretization\"!

But now I have a more complex IGES model (I didn't create it) and I'm not able to obtain a solid. I'd like to know wich operations are needed and in which order to apply them. I didn't find any tutorial, it will be very appreciate.Thisis the link to my geometry file. Thanks for your attention.",

I can explode the imported STEP file into several shells, I can assemble them and build one only shell but there are always a few free edges or holes somewhere.

I can import it in Salome without troubles and build a single solid without troubles (and fast!). I'd like to have known that before, I've been struggled with IGES file for months! So, if it can helps: DO NOT START FROM IGES MODEL! At least in Rhinoceros.Anyway, I think there's a problem about units of measure. An IGES file is imported without scaling (but I remember there was a problem about exporting, at least with Salome 5.1.4 it became larger), but a STEP file is reduced to 1/1000!!! Is an automatic conversion from mm to m? How can I get rid of this? I want to 'work in mm', i'm afraid about precision.",

Is an automatic conversion from mm to m? How can I get rid of this? I want to 'work in mm', i'm afraid about precision.Same problem here: the default precision of 10^-6 is too much if the edge has a lenght of 10^-3.What I do as very first operation after step import is always to rescale the solid to 1000:1, so I can continue to mantain my mind on mm rather than convert everything in meters.This behaviour is changed from Salome 4 to 5, I didn't understand the reason, may be in EDF they work on big solids and they use meters, but for general mechanic the use of mm is mandatory so this problem make things unconfortable.",

I already did like you: I rescale the model to 1000:1 and I export it in STEP format for Salome.I hope EDF will fix that: I don't understand why STEP files should be 'rescaled' and IGES files not (at least you are asked if you want take into account of units)."

OCC & VTK: The \"Show Only\" feature does not work properly.  If you \"Show Only\" one solid, then do the same with another one, both are displayed.  Repeat this with a third solid, then all three are displayed.  They just get turned on, but never off!  Have not tested it with other entities like points, lines, wires, faces, etc.  The \"Hide\" will not hide a feature.  One can only \"Hide\" ALL the features that are shown!Once all these solids have been turned on, selecting one of these objects does NOT work, for example to explode entities from it.The same *.hdf file opened in 5.1.3 works as expected.2. OCC: Once a solid has been exploded, when one selects a sub-entity its name is not highlighted in the Object browser!  Thus one can never find out the identity of a geometric entity. Conversely, selecting an entity in the Object Browser window does not highlight it in the OCC window.JMB",

A right behavior is that at re-computing after hyp modification there is a warning saying that the re-compute may fail + proposition to make a full re-compute instead of partial one.Problem is that when one modifies a local hypothesis, only a part of mesh is cleared and then re-computed. In your case a remaining part is quadratic and newly computed part is linear that leads to failure of 'Extrusion 3D'.I observe a right behavior if I modify \"Number of segments\" just after conversing a mesh to quadratic but not after loading a study with a ready mesh.

I also suppose that your pipe is a triangular mesh.But \"Sew Border To Side\" connects the border to links between nodes of the side. See the attached picture to get what I mean. I sewn a plane to a cylinder. As a result, the plane is no longer planar, the same will become with your disk as well.Write if your still what to use sewing, then I'll explain how to set parameters.BR. St. Michael",

Maybe it can be clearer if I say that the disk closes the pipe.The third kind of sewing seemed to be the needed one at first, but I'm not so sure because I'll sew the disk on an \"edge\" of the pipe.So, my main problem -I hope i'll be the only one- is to find how to fill the fields, i.e. which nodes are needed for salome to understand my request...regardsJérémie",

The only issue I am facing now is creating groups of faces so that I can use it for applying Boundary conditions in my solver later on. When I work with the final geometry I have too many faces (420 or so) when I use Explode function. I was wondering what the best approach is? My fluid domain is basically the annulus and the cavities. The side faces of the cylinder will be inlet/outlet. The remaining faces will be either rotating surface or fixed wall.

Using my script for example we can use faces of Cylinder_1 and Sphere_1 to find 2D elements on them even though they are split in the final model. I attach a script using this approach.

I think this effect is due to vicinity of a sphre pole where surface parametrization is far from being uniform.You can try to smooth 2D mesh before 3D meshing. I.e. do not specify Hexahedron algo when you create a mesh; after computing 2D mesh, smooth it, add hexahedron algo and compute the mesh again.If result of smoothing does not satisfy you, you can use other workarounds. E.g. replace cuts of sphere where the mesh is wrong by cuts of a rotated sphere where mesh is OK.Alternatively you can use \"Import 1D-2D elements from other mesh\" algo. See an attachement.St.Michael",

                "Hi everyone,I am working with a geometry I imported in IGES. I see with the \"What is\" tool that I do have a solid. If I \"check\" it, I obtain \"This Shape seems to be valid.\"However, I cannot manage to mesh it. I tried several algorithms. Among others, NETGEN 1D-2D-3D meshes the surfaces but fails when trying to mesh the solid:NETGEN_3D failed on subshape with error COMPERR_ALGO_FAILEDI think that the problem comes from the small areas that I have (see the image attached).I tried to fix it with the \"Repair\" tool, but without success.Is there a way to automatically \"merge\" those small area?Any other suggestion?Thank you!Pierre",
                "Ok, normally Salome from 5.x in advance has this problem: each solid imported from step or iges is scaled to a factor 1:1000, it means that an edge of 100 mm in the CAD system, is imported with lenght 0.1 (adimensional) in Salome. This matter because the salome tolerance per default is 10^-6, and it is not the same to apply it to an edge with leght 10^2 or 10^-1. Said this, it is easy to understand why salome fail to close edges.In my experience, the very first operation to do after importing a solid in Salome =>5.x, is to re-scale it with a 1000:1 factor to recover the right conditions betweeen edge leght and tolerance! This is a regression because in Salome 3.x and 4.x the woraround was not necessary due to the correct behaviour during geonetry import.One more thing: it is better to remove these fillets or chamfers when still in the CAD system if you don't need them, because salome lacks of a powerful defeaturing tool",

You can try to improve 2D mesh in 2 ways:1) If a very dense mesh at some spots in the 1st image is not due to presence of small geometrical edges then you can improve your mesh by increasing Min Size parameter of Netgen 3D Parameters hypothesis. Netgen won't create element of linear size > Min Size.2) You can decrease difference in size of adjacent elements by decreasing Growth Rate parameter (you need to set Fineness to Custom before).St. Michael",

I tried giving the original IGES geometry, but also a new solid create from the imported one (explode in faces -> create Shell -> Create Solid).In both cases, it complains that the input isn't valid for this command.

                "Dear All,>Introduction:it is no secret I mainly use Salome as a mesher for OpenFOAM. Unfortunately I have not succeeded yet in learning how to use the hexablock-tool of Salome. Therefore I have come back to try OpenFOAM's snappyHexMesh. The required STL-files I create with Salome's SMESH. SnappyHexMesh is a nice tool, but the functionality concerning edges is rather limited and difficult to use. One has to use a tool called surfaceFeatureExtract for creating files with an .eMesh extension. These files are supposed to tell snappyHexMesh where the edges are not to be altered from the STL-file which is the basis of everything. Unfortunately surfaceFeatureExtract has its limitations as soon as you have crossings of round structures. <Actual question: I would like to export selected edges from within Salome SMESH into OpenFOAM-usable .eMesh-files. Does anyone already have a solution for that?Background Info: Salome SMESH is great for creating STL-files for use within OpenFOAM's snappyHexMesh. The .eMesh files list all the edges and points thereon which are not to be altered by snappyHexMesh. In general, each .eMesh contains first a list of points and then a list of edges defined by these points. For example, if an edge in the STL is split in two lines, in the eMesh it would be represented aspoints((0 0 0) // point 1(1 0 0) // point 2(1 1 0) // point 3);edges((1 2) // edge between points 1 and 2(2 3) // edge between points 2 and 3);If it was only a matter of writing out the points, I guess it would be a task for the group definitions. But the problem are the edges which have to be defined according to the list of points...Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions?Cheers,Bernhard",

            "discussion": [
                "Hi all,I'm really new to Salome and Code-Aster, and I gotta say that  it's been  a really steep learning curve, as I haven't experienced before.Now, I have my model composed of 8 volumes in a STEP file, for which I want to have a consistent mesh. I know that code-aster might deal with non-consistent meshes by using LIASON_MAIL in command AFFE_CHAR_MECA, but also I want to have the consistent mesh to be able to solve it in another program.The threads I've found about STEP import are a bit old (several years old), and I couldn't find a 'standard' procedure to do it. As far as I understood:1) Import the assembly from the STEP file. This creates a single entity.2) Explode that entity into volumes (and faces if needed for boundary conditions)3) Create a partition using those volumes from 2). This should create an assembly, whose components are connected but not fused.4) Create the mesh from that partition, with sub-meshes for specific mesh control within the elements of the meshWell, that's exactly what I've done. The assembly seems to be properly imported:[IMG]http://i63.tinypic.com/dyoqig.png[/IMG]But unfortunately, it seems to be a problem when performing the partition. As you might see below, the partition seems to be composed of 9 solids:[IMG]http://i68.tinypic.com/4fy5px.png[/IMG]but it misses one of the main volumes (the one in color dark green), and the solid 9 and solid 10 are actually the same object, but they're a face:[IMG]http://i67.tinypic.com/2v2gmqe.png[/IMG]Now I'm trying exploding all the faces and create the shells and the volumes from there, but one of the shells doesn't create the volume even after the sewing repair process. But even if it works, it's a cumbersome process, and I think there's a simpler way of working with those assemblies, isn't there?Well, thx in advance for any idea to solve it or finding the mistake.cheers,Ferney",
                "Hi FerneyYou got a solid looking like a face probably because of a small tolerance of your model.To avoid this, try either of the following options:- useGlue Facesinstead of Partition. Tolerance should be large enough to cover a gap between faces that should be glued.- Increase tolerance of your model (Repair > Limit Tolerance) BEFORE applying Partition.Note that to use Partition there is no need to explode the model into solids, just use the model as a single Object. I mean exclude point 2) from you list. Extract faces for boundary conditions from a result shape of Partition or Gluing and not from the imported shape.St.Michael",
                "Hi St. Michael,Thx for your quick answer. I tried both approaches, but I didn't succeed. Therefore, I still don't knowing what else to try.- I couldn't use 'Glue faces' instead of partition because if I try to use the imported solid as gluing 'selected shape' it says \"SIGSEGV 'segmentation violation' detected. Address 0\", I guess it's because it requires more than 1 object to work. If I explode the solid into the composing solids and try to make the 'glue faces' on them, I can't select them as object, so I guess it isn't possible to use this command that way.- Now, if I try to increase the limit tolerance, I have to do it to the imported solid. This creates a new geometrical object, and then I try to apply the partition to that new entity, but it shows \"Partition driver fails\".On the other hand, I was able to mesh it by:1) exploding the imported solid into faces2) Create again the volumes from closed shells, which were created from the faces in 1)3) Create a mesh with a sub-mesh for finer meshing in the small volumes.The resulting mesh is this one:[IMG]http://i63.tinypic.com/6tpgt4.png[/IMG]However, it's not exactly what I wanted to be, mostly because I had to tick on the 'limit size by surface curvature' option. Otherwise, the mesh wouldn't be created at all (sighs).Well, if you might have another ideas, or another procedure to have my STEP file working, I'll be more than happy to try it. Thx again.Ferney",
                "I see that you coped with geometry construction. Now you are not satisfied because your mesh is too refined.Switching OFF 'limit size by surface curvature' leads to meshing failure probably because some of solids are very thin and hence coarse 2D meshes of their faces intersect each other.Have you tried to make your mesh coarser by increasing Min Size parameter?St.Michael",
                "Hi,I tried, but the limiting parameter is 'limit size by surface'. Definitely, I must apply it, otherwise it won't mesh. By the moment, I can work with this mesh, but my fundamental issue was about how to deal with STEP imported geometries, because as I noted above my up-to-now workflow would be:1. Import the STEP file and explode it into faces [new entity / explode]2. Create shells with the faces from 1) [new entity / build / shell]3. Repair the shells with sewing. This was necessary for 5 out of 8 volumes, so I guess it'd be an standard procedure. [repair / Sewing]4. Create volumes from the sewn shells in 3) [ new entity / build / volume]5. Create a partition using all volumes created in 4) [Operations / partition]6. Explode partition from 5) into faces and volumes (if needed for Boundary conditions and sub-meshes) [new entity / explode]7. Play with the mesh module to find the right meshing parametersWell, so far it's, but as I noted before, it's cumbersome and time consuming. I  hope somebody has another workflow to deal with those imports from STEP. I'd be more than happy to try an easier and faster approach to mine",
                "In the case if STEP file contains SOLIDs, either Glue Faces or (Limit tolerance + Partition) should work.If you share your model I can try to figure out why this simple approach does not work for you.Why you are unhappy with 'limit size by surface' switched ON?St.Michael",
                "I'm not unhappy with the 'limit size' switched on. The problem is that at some points it creates way too many elements (and the geometry on those points is smooth). This creates and unnecessary density on some spots of the mesh, but as I told you, later I can start playing with those meshing parameters. By now my concern is to be able to run a simple simulation before tomorrow, cause I have to prove my boss, that Salome-meca is a viable alternative to a pricy commercial software the small-sized company is about to buy.As I mentioned, I tried both methods but didn't succeed, or probably I did it wrongeither way here is my file:http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=31437736141338424560I'd do appreciate if you could take a look.thx and cheers,Ferney",

                "I think that it might be some problems with the file. Actually, my CAD system doesn't have direct STEP export, but parasolid instead. So, I uploaded to grabcad.com, and download from there in STEP, as they have some conversion algorithms to be able to download in any CAD format.Probably somewhere in that process an imperceptible error might had been introduced into the solids, and this is affecting the process.To your question of how did I managed to do it...well, I exploded each face on the solid. At the volume boundaries there should be 2 faces identical, or more or less, so I erased on of those 'identical' faces so the another could act as boundary for both volume. Later create each shell selecting properly the right faces enclosing each volume (this is tiring and boring), and once the shells are formed, then I applied the repair/ sewing with a tolerance of 0.1 m to obtain a closed shell, because for some of the shells that were initially created weren't completely closed.That way I could create the solids, which I ended up by joining in a partition and mesh it.I do hope my next models will be easier to import, but at least we have a new \"bulletproof\" method in case the simpler ones don't work.St. Michael thank you very much once again for all your help, you're a great value on this forum",

After working with the mesh I had before, now I had to modify the geometry due to some requirements from my client.Also, I decided to draw the solids in Rhinoceros, as it's a specific 3D solid modeling tool. So everything was re-drawn from scratch.1) In my first try, I imported all solids as a compound. Then applying 'Glue faces' and then meshing. Definitely, meshing didn't work when using the 1D-2D-3D-netgen hypothesis.2) Instead I used: 3D: Tetra (netgen), 2D:Nefisto, 1D: wire (adaptative). This created a mesh. However, I noticed that it wasn't a consistent mesh, and that'd be a problem for Aster (see attached image).3) Then I tried to import each solid individually and create the partition...but after 1.5 hours of processing it says \"partition aborted non valid shape result\"..wow what a disappointment.4) Then I tried to create a compound based on the 21 individual solids, and create a partition out of this compound and checking the \"No sub-shapes intersection \" option. This created a fast partition, but when I try to mesh it (with 1D-2D-3D-netgen), it gets stuck in the 99% of the meshing processing, so I can't figure it out if it worked or not.5) If I create the compound out of the 21 solids and apply 'glue faces' I obtain almost the same mesh as in 2)Any help is always welcome, and if you're interested, you might find the  files here:STEP file:http://www.filedropper.com/molinos20151122STEP files (each solid separated):http://www.filedropper.com/separadoshdf file:http://www.filedropper.com/molinos20151122bThx and cheers,ferney",

There are many skew lines that seem to be obliged to coincide by design. Note that tangent contacts are most difficult for Partition (and for any other Boolean operation).Your model is so difficult that it is even visualized incorrectly. One of two faces in the picture fails to be shown in shading mode.Glue Faces can be used for a geometry where all faces of contact of solids are (almost) equal. Your case is not such one.

Is there any way to check (visual or text) what faces were glued with the operation?I thought to go back and do again what I did before, i.e. exploding faces and creating back the solids inside Salome, but now the model is too complicated for that, and my issue is that most of my cases are gonna be like this, if not a bit more complex. Therefore, I'm also interested in finding a workflow that can be used in a standard way.@Matthias, I also thought about doing it GMSH, everybody say that it's simple and useful, but I find it too difficult to set the parameters. On the other hand, how can I define the physical groups there, when I import the Step file I can't see the solids composing the assembly to assign them to gropus. The same with the faces to create groups for the BCs. Any idea of how it's done there?

                "Hi all,I continue working on this..I'm getting frustrated.After the comment from St. Michael, I decided to check the geometry...and I found that when I import the STEP files there were some significant gaps between solids. I still son't know if it's just a visualization problem, or if actually the geometry isn't importing properly. therefore, I decided to export the geometry as IGES, I had to export and import each of the 21 solids. Although it isn't impossible, it's kinda boring.Unfortunately, IGES isn't a format to carry information of solids, but of surfaces. But surprisingly, the geometries were better respected when imported. as a consequence, I decided to use them and use the approach that I used before (described above), and which consist of exploding all faces and creating back the solids. Attention was given to use a single surface to define two coinciding solids.It was a tremendous task, but I did it!, first I have to select the faces that will be part of the solid (faces might come from different IGES 'solid', as they are shared by two solids.Afterwards, myidea was to create an assembly by applying the 'glue faces' command, but it fails saying \"the tolerance is too big. Sticked shapes are detected\"...what does it mean? I tried with different values of tolerance. I even applied an 'increase tolerance=0.001'  before gluing, but it doesn't workThen I group the created solids into a compound and apply partition over that entity (no sub-shape intersection is checked), and tried to mesh it...without successIt tells me error problems, and when I look to the created mesh it's not conformant. So, how can I achieve that. I mean, I spent several hours creating again each volume to be sure that faces are exactly the same one for coincident volumes, but this also doesn't work.Here's the link to my current study, if someone is interested and have some time. Any ANY additional idea would be more than welcome:http://www.filedropper.com/molinos20151124cthx and cheers, ferney",

                "Hello, everyone,First of all, I would like to congratulate everybody working on the \nSalome project because this software is, so far, the best open CAD \nsoftware I know. I very like to work with it, even if I have still lots \nof questions about its use.For example, the aim of this conversation is to better understand how\n does the Radial Prism works. The question of prismatic layer generation\n is crucial and must be mastered by everyone who wants to make suitable \nmeshes for vicious CFD.Going through the Salome documentation, I have understood that one of the best tool to do that in 3D was the Radial Prism (http://docs.salome-platform.org/salome_5_1_5/smesh/user/index.html) which \"fill the space between two shells with [prismatic] meshes\".The documentation page of Radial Prism being not illustrated, it can \nbe difficult to understand what using Radial Prism exactly boils down \nto. According to me, it consist infillinga void space betweentwo shells(surfaceelements) which arefitting togetherlikeRussian dolls.So,\n I tried to do such test with very simple geometry to begin with: two \ncubes of which I extracted the shells as on the following picture:http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=5075152.pngThen, I made a simple 2D mesh on the inner shell (Netgen 1D-2D):http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=6486773.pngAfter that, I made a \"void\" mesh on the outer shell, just to create \nsubmeshes on its edges with a 1D Projection from the inner mesh:http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=8267104.pngand then other submeshes on its faces with a 2D Projection from the same mesh:http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=4228131.pngFinally, I had two meshes:- One simple on the inner shell.- One \"void\" mesh with submeshes on each faces which are the projection of the inner mesh.So, I can say that I have\"two meshed shells\"as required in the documentation, one of which is the\"2D Projection of the other shell\".Then, I made a compound of the shells to have the geometry on which I\n could apply this Radial Prism. But it doesn't work, creating just 16 \nnodes at the corners of the both shells:http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=921397screenshot11.pngRecognising this system of \"void\" mesh with submeshes was a bit \nstrange, I tried to mesh simply each face of the outer shell in \ndifferent meshes, then to make a compound from the inner shell and the 6\n faces of the outer shell and tried again. The result was the same.So, I don't know how to use this tool despite I am persuaded that it is very useful for CFD.Can somebody help me and people who will be interested in this tool ?Very Sincerely,",

The total number of elements before and after merging is printed.- mesh_prism.py: for showing another way to get the result you want. I use the algorithm \"radial quadrangle\" to mesh the top and bottom faces with quadrangles and triangle around the corner, and the algorithm \"prism\" to extrude the top-face mesh to the bottom face.To conclude, 2 advices:- work on geometry as mush as you can (i.e. use mesh transformations only when you can't do it on geometry)- next time you submit hdf file, please don't delete intermediate objects, it will be much easier to understand the steps you have followed. I had to dump your study and look at the generated python scriptsChristophe"

Now, I want to mesh according to surface curvature (denser mesh in high curvature areas). I used NETGEN 1D-2D hypothesis and meshed it with an appropriate accuracy.The problem is that the created mesh has high density at low curvature area as shown in attached picture (the denser area beside the end) . I must say that the surface is the outer shell of a turbine blade.I really appreciate any help...H. Parvaz",
                "HelloThe most simple solution I see is to separate the too refined part of the surface using Partition. As a result your surface will be divided into two faces so that you will be able to create a sub-mesh on the too refined face in order to use another mesher (e.g. Triangle(Mefisto)) or to set up other Parameters of NETGEN 1D-2D (to limit min size of element). The steps to follow are:1) In GEOM module, create a cutting shape, say a box, and perform Partition (menu Operations / Partition): Object = your surface, Tool = the box.2) Explode the Partition result shape into faces (menu New Entuty / Explode).3) In Mesh module, create a sub-mesh in your mesh. Geometry: the too refined face; Algorithm: NETGEN 1D-2D; Hypothesis: NETGEN 2D Parameters where you set up a desired Min Size.St.Michael",

The problem is at the near-end section of part (that I pointed in the newly added attachment).As clear, this area is approximately a smooth and has low curvature. So, It shouldn't have dense mesh!But about your suggestion, this is a part of my Ph.D thesis research and I need to study the both condition (part with one NURBS surface and with at least four surfaces)Do you think it is a problem with mesher or the imported geometry?RegardsH. Parvaz",
                "Dear H. ParvazI know that NETGEN determines element size basing on surface curvature. Apparently your surface is not so smooth as it looks in the Viewer. Probably there are small oscillations of surface at the place in question. Maybe you can see these oscillations at large zoom and the smallest possible Deflection Coefficient (set it up in pop-up menu of your surface in the Viewer). Attached is an image showing the oscillations at surface boundary.",
                "Dear Saint MichealYou are right! I accept that my surface is not smooth in all of its domain. But, I meshed this surface with a CAD software (Solidworks 2013 and its curvature based meshing function) and the result was owesome (the attached image). Now, it is impossible for a pre and post-processor software Salome not to be able to compete a CAD based meshing software.But about smoothing my surface: I constructed the surface with BSplineSurface command in OCC and I think it is impossible (or at least too complex) to have a completely smooth surface output. So, there must be a way for NETGEN 1D-2D to neglect small curvature variations. Something like Solidworks meshing does.Anyway, I think there must be a way to decrease NETGEN1D-2D sensitivity to small curvature variations. I don't know whether it usesDeflectionparameter or not and is it adjustable.RegardsH. Parvaz"

The case is simple: I have two geometrical groups sharing edges. I would like to apply on both a submesh with the Netgen 1D 2D algo. (I really need to use this algo because inside the groups are edges which have to be discretized by curvature and the Netgen 1D 2D algo is the best to do so.)One submesh has to be finer than the other one. Sometimes, the coarser submesh has a higher priority than the finer mesh, and it leads to an ugly final mesh.The problem is that when I try to change the order of submeshes, there is no effect at all...Attached is a study dump in which there is such problem.I would very like this submesh order to work fine!Best regards,William",

                "Hello guys,I would like to mesh two spheres which they have a contact point in common on the external surface. For my case study i need to refine the external surface of two spheres with layers (becouse i have a chemical reaction on the surface and it has to be really fine) but i do not know how to do it with salome (i use salome 6.6.0). Generally i use NETGEN 1D-2D-3D. but i cannot get a really refined mesh around the contact point which is the important point to study.I did not use the phyton script, i just used the geometric and meshing part of salome. In the following website you can see pictures of the mesh that i wanna do and the other mesh that i get with salome. If you need more do not hesitate to ask me!In the website you ll find two pictures. One is called contact_point wchich is the one that i would like to get, the other one is called my_mesh_salome and it is made by me with salome!(I just made this account and i do not know how to give the access, i think that i have to share the link where i put my files; let me know if it works)http://www.filedropper.com/filemanager/index.php/apps/filesI heard about extrusion 3D but i tried too many times but did not work, i get errorsWhat do you suggest to do?best regardsalvo",

                "Hello,After having trying for days, during free time, to do what is  visible in your pictures, the conclusion is that it is not trivial at all.I first tried to use the automatic prism layer algorithm but it didn't ensure connectivity between prisms and the refined area at the center.Then, I tried to use theExtrusion 3Dalgo on thin spherical shapes describing the prismatic layers, but this created negative volumes at some positions.Then, I split these spherical solids into quarters, so as to help the Extrusion 3D algo to do the job. And it worked.But the next step was to solve some sub-mesh priority problems to remove meshing errors, and this necessitated to create additional sub-meshes.Not to say some zero-length edges are present in the geometry because of the spheres. And it could lead to some problems. The solution was to very well split the meshing process using suitable algorithms for each sub-mesh...You can see here the final result:To refine the mesh at the contact point, I used aLocal Sizesparameter with theNetgen 1D-2D-3Dalgo:Here is the HDF file:http://www.filedropper.com/twospheres-clearedmeshhdfThe computation of the mesh can be long. It generated around 2.5 million cells for me.Best regards,William",
                "Hi SalvoYou can get a mesh similar to \"contact_point\" using \"Local Sizes\" option of NETGEN Parameters. There you can specify (1) a vertex, created in Geom module, where you need the finest mesh and (2) the element size you need at this point. With \"Grading\" parameter = 0.1 you will get a mesh with elements growing in size very slowly around the specified vertex.I don't remember if \"Local Sizes\" feature exists in 6.6.0.St.Michael"

                "Hello,I believe that this occurs because you cannot refine the mesh along a single line that doesn't have defined \"opposite edges'. Someone can correct me if I am wrong.When you create a sub-mesh you can add the option of \" additional hypothesis\" (see attached). This is easier to see if you have hexahedrons instead of tetrahedrons.  In geometry: Create a new line group with one of the edges of the cube. Then, add this edge as a sub-mesh and see how it changes by adding or removing this \"additional hypothesis\". That should show why you need additional edges to do what you want.Best regards,Daniel",

I think the inner edge is then somehow considered as a boundary of the model.I will test other options (mesh sewing?), or even remeshing using other tools.I will upload a solution when (if?) I find one.Until then, any suggestion is welcome.Thanks again, be safe during this period, and see you.Regards,Théophile"

But it's not convenient, IMHO, to use Snappy as a stand-along mesher (we have a few Ansys licenses but I'd like to have a \"backup\" freeware CFD tool, I chose CodeSaturne for our needs but it has not built-in mesher).",

I've imported the aerofoil, built the domain and created various faces which I'm gonna mesh then eventually extrude by one cell for use in OpenFoam.However, I'm really struggling with the meshing process. The approach I've been trying is 2D quadrangle algorithm, 1D wire discretization algorithm, then n.b. segments hypothesis. However, with this it complains there is more than 4 sides (I believe it is classing the section of the airfoil surface as multiple edges), therefore I tried composite side discretization as the 1D hypothesis, however this isn't working either.As you can probably tell I'm pretty new at this, and I'm rather stumped.

In the front area of the wing the length of the section to interpolate is much shorter than in the back section (check the screenshot).  I think that the interpolation function implemented in salome is not able to deal with the form. It maybe makes sense to divide the back section in several additional sections.Best regards,Stefan",
                "Hello everybodyStefan, splines made with the interpolation tool of Salome always go through the exact position of the input vertexes.I make especially foil meshing and the first step of my work is often to rebuild the foils with this tool. Then I create only two blocks (sometime only one) around it and it works fine.What I see in your screenshot, Blue Jay, is probably a display matter (which is very common in Salome). To fix it, select your geometrical object (eg. your face), left-click in the 3D window, and selectDeflection Coefficient. Then, reduce it to its minimum (by adding some 0s after the period). Like this your face's edge should well follow your foil on the screenHope this solved the problemBest regardsWilliam",
                "Hi William,thx for the information - i didn't know that.Do you know a possibility to decrease the Deflection Coefficient in general? If i change it in the preferences menu then it's only taken into account for one session.Best Regards",
                "If i change it in the preferences menu then it's only taken into account for one session.Yes... I have the same problem and I don't know how to fix it. One time I installed Salome 6.5.0 on a Ubuntu 10.10 version and all the settings were saved between each session. But most of time I install Salome, this is not the case. And I don't why.I personnaly use the Debian 4.0 Etch binaries and the Install Wizard.Maybe a developer could help us about this?...I am also interrested in this issueWilliam",
                "William,That was indeed the problem! I suspected it was probably a display issue, so I carried on anyway, and now have a decent looking quad mesh! Now to try and fine-tune it and get it running. Many thanks for your help guys.Cheers,Jamie",

                "Guys,I've actually got one more question with regards to meshing algorithms if that's ok? I've been using the 'local length' hypothesis to get all cell lengths around my foil surface consistent. However, they seem to diverge to the nodes above - i've attached a screen shot to show you what I mean. The cells I'm talking about are in the submesh on the upper right of the foil, under the 'orthogonal mode' icon. Is this just the hypothesis not set correctly? I didn't use 'propogation of 1D hyp. on opposite edge' as it wouldn't work. I'm assuming this is as it would try to keep the same cell length as at the surface, and as the edges are different lengths a quad mesh wouldn't be possible. I'll attach the dumped study in another post in case it helps.Once i've got the cell lengths consistent, i'll propagate them away from the foil surface and hopefully the mesh will be ready to run - i'll post a pic of the mesh then!Many thanks",
                "Here is the dumped study.Many Thanks",
                "Hello Blue JayI have some problem to run your dump study (it seems that the 6.6.0 version generates sometimes corrupted dump studies because I had a similar problem earlier...).But looking to your screenshot, I guess you made some mistake when applying your hypotheses. Indeed, all your edges excepted one have exacly 15 segments, which is the default value for theNb. Segmentshypothesis. So I guess you didn't apply theLocal Lengthto all your edges...In your script, I see that you apply your sub-mesh on sub-geometries that you exploded. But I recomend you to use groups (far more practical to use). In the Geometry module, you can create groups on your object to mesh (right-click on your object in the study tree, thenCreate Group). Like this, you can create a group containing all your edges touching the foil and apply on them only one hypothesis (eg. yourLocal Length)Hope this helpsWilliam",
                "Hi Blue Jay,i tried to set the Local length hypothesis to receive an equal node distribution around the airfoil - in my case it worked without problem (see the attached figure). But with an equal distribution and a fine mesh you receive in the front area of the airfoil quickly bad elements. If you create a very fine mesh then you get in the back area bad elements or you reach the max. element border. From my point of view it makes maybe sense to work with a non-equal distribution. What do you think? Can you maybe write a few sentences about the mesh requirements?To William:I tried the hypothesis \"Number of elements\" with an unequal distribution. With that settings i receive a very strange mesh. I think the reason is the orientation of the lines (node 1 to node 2 or node 2 to node 1). Did you make a similar experience?Regards",
                "Hello MaxHappy New YearWithout screenshot it is difficult to say anything. But if you think the problem is the orientation of edges, you can switch them when editing theNb. Segmenthypothesis.If you edit your submesh, then if you click on the \"edit\" button beside your hypothesis, (and if you select a non uniform distribution of nodes), then the edges will appear in the 3D window under the form of arrows. You can select them and add them to the \"reversed edge list\" by clicking on theAddbutton. Like this, the edges will be meshed \"upside down\". (The best to be able to select them is to hide everything before editing the hypothesis, and then don't hesitate to strongly zoom on the edges to select...)Hope this answered your questionHave a nice dayWilliam",
                "Hey guys, happy new year!I agree a non-uniform distribution would make more sense, however I'm getting really confused now with this local length hypothesis, as everything I do seems to throw up errors. If I set a section of the foil surface to a cell length, do I need a hypothesis for the outer edge of that domain section?Max, I tried to set a local length for the whole foil surface, similar to what you did, and cannot even get a coarse mesh, it continually fails. Something like you produced in your screenshot would be a great start. I keep getting errors at the edges of the domain. I understand that some cell lengths are likely to throw up errors, however no matter what cell length I choose, no section of the mesh is error free. I've attached a screen shot to show what I mean, and I'll attach the dumped study as well in case you can see anything obvious that I'm doing wrong. I really appreciate this help, I'm just going round in circles here!",

                "Hello, Jay,I have again problem running your dump study... It stops during the meshing step with the error:Traceback (most recent call last):>\n  File \"input\", line 1, in module<br>\n  File \"/home/tougeron/Desktop/airfoilmesh.py\", line 1257, in module>\n[ SubMesh_1, SubMesh_2 ] = Mesh_1.GetMesh().GetSubMeshes()<br>\nValueError: too many values to unpackBut the geometry was built and I could try to do the same as you did and I had the same problem as in your screenshot.The reason is simpleWhen you propagate theLocal Lengthalgorithm, you apply the same local length on your foil as on your farfieldInstead of propagation, you can use theProjection 1Dhypothesis on your \"farfield\" edges. It will \"copy\" the node distribution exactly as you wanted to do with the propagation.I also noticed a problem in your geometry: your blocks are not \"glued\" together, leading to redundant faces between each of them (in your final compound, you should have only one face between two touching blocks). To remove them, your can use theRepair -> Glue Facestool.I hope this time you will succeedBest regardsWilliam",

You should have something like this:geompy.addToStudy(geompy.MakeVertex(\t1\t,\t5\t,0),'Vertex\t1')geompy.addToStudy(geompy.MakeVertex(\t2\t,\t6\t,0),'Vertex\t2')...5- Copy-paste your sheet into a text file, save it under the .py format, load it into Salome and press [F5].

            "discussion": [
                "I'm trying to integrate Salome in a toolflow that starts with some custom software that builds 3D geometries on the fly based on user inputs and simulates them in Elmer. The whole toolflow is script based. To use Elmer, I need to create mesh groups and export them in UNV format. However, it's not clear to me how to identify the solids used to create the groups.Basically, my software writes a brep file containing the entire geometry (a compound of solids, ready to be meshed) and an .sif file for Elmer which maps solids to material properties. The brep file can be imported in Salome and meshed. Now, if I explode the compound, Salome creates a number of solids corresponding to the solids written in the compound,BUTthese solids are in a different order than in the brep file. Therefore, should I declare groups based on the new order of solids, the material properties for these would be incorrect.Currently, I'm using Gmsh for meshing. The good thing is that the order of solids is preserved, so I know that solid #1 written in the brep file, is volume #1 in Gmsh, and, physical volume #1 in Elmer, and, therefore, the proper material properties are assigned to it (same for #2, and #3, aso). In Salome, I cannot make the same assumption, since the order of the exploded solids is scrambled. For example, in a test geometry, I'm having an air box that is solid #1 in the brep file; after importing the geometry, the air box becomes solid #126, and the material properties are incorrect.Is there some way to either (a) preserve the order of solids in a compound, so they can be identified by their order or (b) select solids based on some other characteristics (e.g. name?, position?) such that I can map the new order of solids to my material properties? Of course, the solution should be scriptable too.Any idea is appreciated,Tibi",
                "Hi TibiAs far as I see your problem is not in different order of solids but in unexpected indexing of sub-shapes. In SALOME a global indexing of sub-shapes of all dimensions is used. I.e. if a shape contains several solids then indices of its sub-shapes will be as following#1 - the shape it-self#2 - the 1st solid#3 - a shell of the 1st solid#4 ... #n - all the rest sub-shapes of the 1st solid#n+1 - the 2nd solid#n+2 ... #n+m - all sub-shapes of the 2nd solidetcSo if you get all solids of your imported shape using the following command>>>  solids = geompy.SubShapeAll( shape, geompy.ShapeType[\"SOLID\"])then 'solids' are in the same order as in your file.RegardsSt. Michael",

Follow the steps:1) mesh one sphere2) create a group of 2D elements generated on the interface face. The easiest way to achieve this is to create a group on geometry.3) Create a mesh on the 2nd part4) Create a submesh on the intermediate face; algorithm = \"Use Existing 2D Elements\", \"Groups of Faces\" of hypothesis = the group created at the step (2).5) Compute the 2nd mesh.This way you get 2 meshes with equal 2D elements on the common geom face.RegardsSt. Michael",

The face is meshed so that there are only 3 segments descretizing the circle. Imagine this mesh after conversion to quadratic, when medium nodes of the 3 segments of the circle appear on the circular edge. The triangles adjacent to the 3 segments will become distorted.To avoid this distortion, the 3 segments are left straight, and you see the warning \"some \nmedium nodes were not placed on geometry\".To see the elements whose nodes were not places on geometry, invoke \"Compute\" of your mesh in GUI just after launching your script.

I have a few rough surfaces through which I simplified through decimation but as a result the boundary of the surface(shell) is slightly different than it originally was. I will be making a solid with some of the shells or using them as a tool for partitioning.So one way is to extrapolate or extend the surface. I've found that for relatively smooth surfaces I can just explode the surface into vertices and make a smoothing surface with it. However for surfaces with a bend inside, it doesn't work very well. I linked an example with the surface and the boundary wire of the original surface (the original surface itself had too many points making the file size huge)Example file on google drive (since it exceeds forum limit):https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz6LAvK9YNYfZE0wVGdxNVlUTTgAlternative, are there ways without involving a lot of manual processes where I can snap the surface boundaries to the wire or split the surface around the bend so I can use the smoothing surface method.Thanks!",

I exploded the solid into all its constituent shells (not faces).  In my case there were only two shells.  The outer and the enclosed inner one.2. I displayed only the inner shell (using the \"eyecon\" or right click \"Hide\" option) and then was able to use that subsequently for defining my boundary condition.Thereby, I avoided having to mess with nearly the 400 odd faces that constituted the original solid; resulting in a quantum reduction in the amount of work required for defining a boundary condition.  Hope this helps others...Regards, JMB"

                "hello,i have to simulate the flow over an open structure made by kelvin cell. I think i need a long domain and i would like to useabout 5*5*10 cells ( each cell made by 36 cylinders).  I use a .py script that works fine  if i do not use cut fuse or common operation.Thus i am able to have the 3D structure by creating a single cell, making of it a compound and  by a series of translations and compound operation i obtain the final structure.However, my understanding is that to build the grid i have to subtract this compound structure from the box of the domain. If i try to do that SALOME STALLED, or very very slow, and after 1 hour i still do not have the final volume.The same happens if i try to fuse all the cylinders together instead of making the compound.Does anybody see a mistake in my procedure? can you suggest a better procedure? or Salome is simply not powerful enough for such a case?I was also wondering if anyone has a suggestion on how to build the grid around such a complex shape? For example is it possible to build a grid only on the outside of a volume not on the inside? so i avoid to do this expensive cut, common and fuse operations..best regards and thankyou for any help...francesco",

                "The script is fine. But I doubt I implement the solution I have in mind very soon, there is some work to do (every day. So I'd like to share my vision so that you could try it by your-self.The main idea is that you proposed initially (realization is in solid_from_shells.py). So, we need a shell composed of outer faces of KelvinCellFoam, as if we had fused all cylinders together.I noted that KelvinCellFoam looks like a mesh, at most of nodes of which 4 cylinders meet, and only 3 cylinders meet at boundary. Hence we can compose a kernel part of KelvinCellFoam of parts consisting of faces of 4 half-cylinders meeting at a \"node\", and accomplish our shell with faces of 3 half-cylinders parts. Then we get a final shape by creating a solid of following shells: a shell of the domain and a shell created from all faces of 4- and 3-horn parts.How to get outer faces of 4 fused half-cylinders (solid), i.e. how to get rid off disk faces at cross sections of cylinders. For this, geompy.GetInPlace() should be used with the 1st arg = the solid and the 2nd arg = a compound of all faces of the 4 cylinders.Hope, I'm clear enough.St.Michael",
                "Hi Saint Michael,Not sure sure if i understand what you are suggesting, and i am not really used to the concept of shells. But it seems to me that the following will help.The Kelving cell foam can be built starting from a Kernell  that share only surfaces but not volumes. Basically  by intersecting the single KelvingCell with a cube  (see attached .py)  you create a cell with half cylinder at the boundaries. Then to build the Foam these boundaries of the cell will touch but not intersect. I didn't go this way originally because i may need to extract also the surface of the kelvin cell and i am not sure how SALOME would handle the shared surfaces.  Hope that this is helpingattachment:KelvinCell_structure_cube is the modified script for the full KelvinCellFoam (here i have commented the final fuse and cut operations that give problems ... ) . The object  KelvinCell is the kernell mentioned before.Thank you a lot for your help...francesco",
                "Hi FrancescoI also thought of similar approach, now I don't remember exactly why I rejected it, probably I did not wanted to fuse many cylinders and create many cutting tools for each side of Kelvin cell. A drawback of my approach is that many differently oriented small parts are necessary.St.Michael",
                "Hii have not understood what geompy.GetInPlace() does and how to use it.Now i have 2 shells (or a series of Shells) that share a face. How to remove the shared 'faces'  and keep only the outer shell?another problem tha i foreseen is to close a shell. for example if i have a closed shell and i cut it i obtain a 'open' shell is there a way to close it again?thank youfrancesco",
                "Hi FrancescoHere is a simple script demonstration the idea. The code is commented.St.Michael",
                "Hi St.Michael,Thank you a lot for the script. i try to find ways and ideas to implement this for my case.but i have a \"theoretical\" question. with this method the total operations is clearly increased compared to simply work with solids.Is this better because boolean operations between shells are much cheaper than those with solids? Why? Is salome selecting point by point the result thus a volume is more expensive than a surface? ...thank you a lotfrancesco",
                "Hi FrancescoThis way is better because it allows minimizing a number of boolean operations performed, as they are used to create only one cell. After that, boolean operations are not used at all. When we create a solid from shells, no boolean operation is used, shells are used as is.St.Michael",
                "Hi Francesco,I am far from being an expert, but looking at the picture you enclosed earlier, it seems that a pattern is reproduced to create the cells you mentionned.Would I be you, instead of reproducing this pattern with copy/symmetry, etc... in GEOM module, I would only draw a single pattern, then mesh it intelligently so that the mesh can be copied, and so on...In short I would rather work on the mesh once it has been created by copy, than on the geometry: this would result in smaller work on GEOM and meshing for Salome.Is such an approach relevant?Bests,Pierre",

I think of creating a Group On Filter with a criterion 'Belong To Geom' = <auxiliary surfaces created between A and C> , with possible further conversion to Standalone Groups and manual edition.St.Michael",

These meshes are inputted by the users and therefore I have to avoid or minimize any manual operations. I think I would be able create the groups by writing a small code that for example detects the elements on the boundaries. However, I am a little bit concerned about the creation of surfaces and solids from the STL files, automatically. I'll give it a go to see how it works.I was hoping that there might be a command in Mesh module which gets the boundary nodes/elements of a region as an input and fills the region with tetrahedral elements.Thanks,MZ",

But this is not your case as I see.However, I am a little bit concerned about the creation of surfaces and solids from the STL files, automatically.Here is a more simple approach:Do not export the groups into STL but create geom edges on group boundaries, make two wires from these edges and create Filling surface on these two wires. Mesh this surface.Together with the two groups this meshed surface forms a closed 2D shell I mentioned above in this post. This shell can be filled with tetrahedra by NETGEN 3D.Again: you need to form the groups of triangles somehow. I can't imagine how you will make them automatically.St.Michael",

I need to make some efforts to make that closed shell though.As another option of was thinking of creating the mesh myself by discretization of the region C using Delanuay triangulation (if I can use sciPy in Salome). Even in this case in need to find the boundary nodes.Thanks,MZ",

                "Hi all,I am very new to Salome and CAE Linux itself and I am trying to get used to the software.I am trying to create MRF Simulation in OpenFOAM or maybe some other solutions (Elmer, Code Saturne).  I have some type of VAWT hybrid turbine modeled in ZW3D then exported to STEP. I have uploaded the STEP file to Salome and I have created 5 new solids in it. 4 of them are for the rotors and as I understand those will be simulating rotors movements. I have also created large cube as main simulation domain.Questions:1) How to measure the model in Salome to make sure it complies with the measurement system chosen during CADing?2) Should I fuse/connect (boole) all the new objects with the imported geometry to create one body or keep it separated?3) Any tips regarding meshing?4) How precisely insert new objects/primitives with a reference to imported geometry? It would save my time comparing to what I did now.5) Is there any benchmark/ simple tutorial on how to set up simple MRF simulation?6) How to apply BC in this case, I will use non slip BC for all faces on the imported model. I understand that mixer BC conditions on the rotation domain would be determined by the rpm or angular velocity but what drives wind turbine in this case?Any useful information will be much appreciated!All the best in the New Year to all",
                "Dear Arek,I am not capable to give answers to all of your points, but here are my comments to some of them:2.) It depends on the case what you have to fuse. In general, I would suggest fusing things that are not moving against each other in reality. For example, I would fuse together elements of a rotor (blades, shaft, etc.), but I would not fuse these with the housing of the rotor.5.) For tutorials of MRF-Setup you have to take a look into the tutorials of OpenFOAM. Salome only allows you to build the geometry and the mesh, but what moves and how is defined in OpenFOAM only. You are better off with that question on cfd-online.6.) Again, the definition of the exact BCs is not done within Salome but within your CFD-software, i.e. OpenFOAM. The only part done in Salome is to define WHERE a BC has to be applied. For more information, take a look athttp://salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/296275377and for exporting the mesh checkhttp://salome-platform.org/forum/forum_12/23863165(The unv-method in my opinion is outdated by salomeToOpenFOAM.py.)As soon as you have some experience with OpenFOAM you will see: Salome is great for creating constant/polyMesh, but the rest has to be done within OpenFOAM itself!Cheers,Bernhard"

It's possible to write a Python script which should do this way:1) Close the gap between boundaries of the stl surfaces with a geometrical face. For this: make 2 geom wires from free edges of surfaces, make a geom face on this wires.2) Mesh this new face with triangles.3) Unite stl surfaces with the mesh on face into one 2D mesh shell.4) Mesh this shell with tetrahedrons.5) Split each tetrahedron into 4 hexahedra.I would take 4 hours maximum to write such a script.

Their values can be constant values, or expressions using others variables of notebook.When you change a value of a variable, click on update study to reflect the  change.CAUTION: be aware that currently notebook is a first version. It will be enhanced in future versions. For example, the update study is very basic: it replays all the operation of the study, including those which do not depend on the modification that you have made. Thus this operation can be very long depending on your study complexity. In a future version, only the operations related to the change of variable will be replayed.If you work with scripts, my advice is to create functions to perform a set of redundant operations. You can also split your scrip into several files (1 for the geometry, 1 for the mesh, ... in fact like the dump).Regards,Gilles",

All the geometry is made of 18 slices of different heights.We built our geometry thanks to the fonctions MakeVertex, MakeLineTwoPnt, MakeArcVertex, MakeWire, MakeFace, MakeShell, MakeSolid and so on.Once our initial geometry is built, we used MakeCompound, then MakeGlueFaces, AddToStudy, and we obtain the final shape (made from all our slices and elements).Then, we tried to redefine elements from this final shape thanks to GetInPlace, GetEdge, GetFaceByPoints, GetFaceByEdges.We have a problem with GetEdge :- when the height of our slices is little, we are confronted to this message :\" GetEdge : several edges found by the given vertices \"- when we multiply all the dimensions by 100 or 1000, the problem is the same.But when we only increase the height of the smallest slices, it works.Can somebody please help us? Is there a tolerance parameter to set? or has somebody already been confronted to this kind of problem?Thank you for your helpClaudia and Fanny",

Probably you face this problem because your slice height is close to tolerance of the vertex at an end of the edge you try to get.

                "Hi St Michael,Thank you for your answer. Unfortunately, we already tried LimitTlorance().In fact, we found in geompy Tolerance() (which give min and max tolerances of the faces, thes edges and the vertices of a shape). It appears our vetices have a tolerance of 9.9 10^-8  The smallest slices on which we try to get egdes have a size of  0.01 and GetEdge() only works with slices bigger than 0.08We don't know what to do to work on correct dimensions, what else could we try?Best regards, Claudia and Fanny",
                "Another possible reason of your problem could be a very short edge near the edge you try to get. But taking into account the way you made your shape, this seems hardly possible.Could you attach your shape (or study) with points where GetEdge() fails?BR,SM",

I do not understand completly why this happens as when you look at your processes, for example with htop, there are times where salome does not consume almost no ram, and no processor, I can imagine that there are some bottle necks in the algorithms that do not consume a lot of ressources but they also take a lot of time..... renumbering mesh maybe? or something like that.... (I am guessing, i have no idea why.)in any case, it is a normal behavior, and when you cancel it you get an error, is also normal as you did not finish of computing the mesh.try reducing the mesh size, (or changing the algorithm, use for 2D mefisto, it takes less memory and is faster.... it might help you....)best regards,franco",

(that was a mesh for a cfd simulation)in that case, or I am missing something or I think that you are doing the meshing wrong.if you want to simulate the fluid around the windmill you should not do a 3D volume mesh of the windmill model, but an external volume (big enought) minus the windmill volume, something like this (https://i0.wp.com/curiosityfluids.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gliderMesh.png?fit=1152%2C860&ssl=1)where the volume mesh is outside the windmill and not inside.so, from there, you have two paths:salome alone:1.you import your step model in geometry module, you create a bounding box bigger than your model (by using the new entry/primitives/box)2. you boolean your windmill to the box, operations/boolean/cut you will obtain a solid that from the exterior is a box and has a \"empty pocked\" inside with the form of the windmill3. you do a 3D mesh of that (you should create the group faces before in the geometry module)4.a export the UNV file (if you do not have pyramids in the model)5.a use ideasUnvToFoam to convert it to a openfoam mesh4.b (recommended) use salomeToOpenFOAM script to export the mesh directly to openfoam format (search this tool in google)known issues that you will have, salome meshing is single thread for the moment therefore you are going to take a lot of time.salome+snappyHex (or cfMesh):1. import your step model in geometry, define the groups you want to be different patches2. mesh your windmill in a 2D mesh prefertly mefisto3. export separate stls for each patch (or if only one if you have only a patch that will be the entire body)4.a use snappyHexMesh (in combination with blockMesh) or cfMesh to create the 3D mesh in OF format.4.b. use cfMesh (if you are using the .com vr of OF it is pre installed, if not there are some indications in the web how to installed.4.ahave a look into this tutorial from part 7 (your geometry does not need any geometry reparation)https://holzmann-cfd.com/community/training-videos/openfoam-usage/exhaust-manifoldor these tuto too (also from tobias)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uom_JPs45Iin the tutorial is an internal flow so it is a little bit different but it explains you everything correctlyfor an external flow (it will change the bounding box size therefore the blockMesh, and the inside mesh point in the snappyhexmesh dict) , you have this tutorialhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc4V79F78AQ&t=733s&ab_channel=LilyStewartbut is a little bit less precise but from the two you will have everything you need4.bfor cfMesh i have not a lot of info as i do not use it but here you have a tuto toohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ne5ZUoObGk&ab_channel=J%C3%B3zsefNagyknown issues, snappy is a little bit difficult to understand (or more precise overwhelming when you beging to use it) but with tobias tutorial you will have all the tools necessary.with  snappy and cfMesh it is difficult to have a good control of the boundary layers.so better control of boundary layers salome path. multi threading (and therefore faster) salome+snappy or cfmesh path.best regards.and good luckPreviously Sebastián H.

How do I then create a \"Segment\". There is nothing in the GUI window that refers to a \"Segment\", does this really mean lines? Should I be keeping the 3D Sketch dialog open or closing it?

I would really appreciate if you could help me with the following matter:Blood pump consists of inlet, outlet and the housing where rotor is positioned. For the main mesh Netgen 1D-2D-3D hypotheses should be used, however inlet and outlet should contain viscous layers at the walls. I have included several screenshots for a better understanding of the geometry (pict on the left). In order to do that. I have divided the geometry into three different parts: 1) inlet; 2) housing 3) outlet.In order to create the mesh for inlet/outlet, I have used Tetrahedron (Netgen) + viscous layers hypotheses --> Netgen 1D-2D. However, I have run to the issue, that two of my meshes do not match at the interface b/n inlet/housing and outlet/housing (pictures of the surfaces included on the right side). The face which belongs to the housing part contains triangular elements inside, the face which belongs to the inlet has cut of tetrahedral elements. Is it possible to mesh inlet the same way as it is done for the housing, however having viscous layers at the walls? Maybe there is a way when I would not need to separate the mesh on 3 parts, but can mesh it all in one.I cannot mesh differently the housing (it should be done this way), however may be I can use another way of meshing the intlet/outlet? Or the mesh just the interface face the same way so they will be perfectly the same?

                "You can achieve this by creating a sub-mesh on one of the geom groups. E.g. you define a greater max size of elements (in hypothesis dialog) when creating the mesh, and you define a less max size of elements when creating a sub-mesh on the group of matrix.St. Michael",

                "Hi ShavkatIn Salome, which actually uses OpenCascade as geometry kernel, surfaces never lose their nature, i.e. an analytical spherical surface remains analytical. If you make union of a sphere and a cone, the resulting solid geometry is bound by patches of the spherical surface, a cone surface and a plane surface. But boundaries of these patches are not analytical (I mean boundaries appeared at intersections of the surfaces).Surfaces obtain polygonal representation, which is additional to some basic description, usually at visualization step.I doubt that this is described in some doc.St.Michael",

Edges connecting different surfaces (or parts of surfaces near the edges) are anyway to be ignored. If surfaces are represented analytically then calculation of surface properties (normal to it, distance between surfaces etc) hopefully are calculated analitycally too, or, at least, very precisely.Best regards,"

For a 3D case, you will need to define face groups (for example, one called \"inlet\", another called \"outlet\", etc.). So, you should click on the \"face\" icon in the dialogue box, then select in the 3D window the sub-geometries your are interested in and then click onAddthenApply. Notice that the [Shift] key has to be used in the 3D window instead of the [Ctrl] key to make multiple selections.Then, in theMeshmodule, right-click in the study tree on the mesh >Create Groups from Geometry, then select in the study tree the groups from theGeometrymodule (thenApply and Close).Once done, you should be able to display your boundaries in the 3D window of theMeshmodule like in the enclosed screenshot.Then, you can export your mesh in OpenFOAM and modify the OpenFOAM files to define the type of your boundary conditions, including the symmetry condition.Best regards,William",
                "Thanks I am familiar with the way of importing and defining the faces in salome, it is very easy and user friendly. Now what I asking is how to divide the full 3D model to 3D model with symmetric face and how to mesh it.Thank you",
                "OK, so you have a mesh and you want to cut in its middle...Not a trivial thing. Personally, I would remesh it completely after having cut the geometry.I have an idea how to do what you want but it would be usable only if implemented into a script (else it would last one day to do it manually). Here is the idea:1- You create in the Geometry module some volume containing the part of the domain to delete.2- In the Mesh module, you cut your mesh using Modification > Remove > Elements, then using a filter of type \"Belong to Geom\" (and using the volume you just created).3- Now you can create a group for the symmetry by using the Modification > Create boundary elements, then by cutting the group (Mesh > Cut Groups) with the other groups you already have (inlet, outlet, wall, etc.).4- The last step is to project the nodes of the symmetry group on the symmetry plane. It's here that a script would be useful. You can try to get all the nodes of the symmetry group, then for each node create a vertex in the Geometry module having the same coordinates, project it on the symmetry plane (Operations > Transformation > Projection), and then affect the new vertex position to the node.Of course, if the symmetry plane is parallel to OXY, OYZ or OZX, you can directly modify the z, x or y coordinate (respectively) of each node to the desired value.I think it should work, but its necessitates some knowledge in scripting.Best regardsWilliam",
                "I hope I well understood what you wanted...If you just want to simply cut the geometry and remesh it completely, you can:Use the Operations > Boolean > Cut tool if you want to mesh a single solidUse the Operations > Partitions tool if you want to mesh a compsolid (with several solids inside). Then you will have to explode your partition (New Entity > Explode) to get the solid you want to keep and to put them in a new compound (New Entity > Build > Compound).In each case you will have to recreate the groups and the mesh in the Mesh module.If you want to copy groups and algorithms/hypotheses/groups between geometrical objects and meshes, you can try thecfdmshscript.I hope this answered your question...Best regardsWilliam",

As a result, when I extrude the face (compound of the first mesh and of its symmetric) along the path and evaluate the mesh, the mesh infos tell me again that there is no node/edge/face/volume.2) In the end, I have a 3D mesh (a compound of 2 extrusions along a path of the same \"middle\" face) and I want to create groups on it. I have seen several forum helps on this topic but none of them could save me. I tried the \"create boundary\" but I get an error \"the source object doesn't contain any 3D elements\". Indeed, when I evaluate the mesh I still have 0 node/edge/face/volume. The strangest thing is that for example when I want to extrude the face along the path, I have to select the starting node and there are all visible. So the nodes and everything are here but they don't appear in the evaluation. I am still looking for a way to create my groups not from the geometry but from this extruded compound mesh.Thanks for your help !",

Else it is normal since Evaluate shows nb of mesh entities which will be computed by meshing algorithms on some geometry.2) You can create the group on the middle face before extruding it into 3D mesh.St.Michael",

You can add some local refinement on the section changes areas, and add a mesh control on the interior side of the shape to keep element size constant along that edge4) Revolute this mesh or use some mesh pocedure to create this as a revoluted mesh5) Now you need to mesh the interior volume of the shaft. If you would mesh it using the same procedure, you'll finish with wedges elements in the center, so in order to have hexas, you need to create a 2D mesh on one of the end plane faces of the shape (take care of matching the element count with the revoluted mesh), and then extrude this mesh along the axis shaft (again taking care of the number of element along the axis of the point 3) to match the nodes)6) After that, make a compound mesh with the option to glue the coincident nodes in order to match any non coincident mesh that could be left.7) After that you can \"simetrize\" your mesh to have a half or the complete geometry meshed.With this procedure you can have 90-95% of hexas and the rest will be wedges, adding more partitions to the geometry and using some mapped algorithm to create the meshes you could reach 100% hexas, but you must weight if this will worth the extra time.Regards, and enjoy your mesh!",

                "Hello,I wish Salome would have the ability to flip the orientation of planar elements in a solid model.  I know one can do that, but there is more to what I am expecting:1. Assume you have a 3D model that consists of tetrahedral elements, with triangular 2D elements plastered all over the outside surfaces of this model.2. Sometimes it happens that some of these 2D elements have outward pointing normals and others are inward pointing.3. Other than tediously picking one or the other set.  It would be nice to have a button (and TUI function) that could reorient all the elements to have outward pointing normals or click again and have them flipped inward.  It should be smart enough to flip only those that need to be flipped, not flip all of them from what they currently are, as is the case now.  I do not want to play a game of \"Reversi\" - I want them all black or all white!4. Perhaps using the geometric center (CG) of the solid as a reference this future function could determine which 2D elements need to be flipped.5. This concept can be extended to purely 2D models where the user can specify a reference point if a CG does not exist or when one chooses not to use it.Let me know if I this key functionality already exists and I have somehow missed it...Regards, JMBPS: For those who have not played the game REVERSI (or Othello) it is described here:https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Reversi.Also available as \"lagno\" on Ubuntu under Games!",

                "Hi all,I am trying to use SALOME in order to obtain three dimensional meshes, that I want to use in OpenFOAM. I am quite impressed by the possibility of the software though I don't understand some details.My problem is the following:I am testing to mesh a 3D box in a channel. I would like to have a first mesh without stretching around the box, and then a streched mesh until the limit of my domain. I can divide the \"regular zone\" around the box in simple rectangle parallepipedes (orange boxes in attached figure) and other trapezoidal parallepidedes (yellow boxes in in attached figure).The sketch I attached is 2D but my problem is 3D so the same thing happen in the vertical plan.1) Is is a good idea to have 2 meshes, one for the orange zone and one for the yellow zone. Does it imply some complications when passing it to OpenFOAM?2)is it better to have one solid by color zone or one solid by block?3)When I try to mesh the yellow zone, one of the face of the parallepipede is split in 4 faces (see an simplified example in the right part of the figure attached). That results in errors for hexahedral meshing.I don't understand how to group the faces in order to have them considered as a single face for the yellow block (though they have to be considered separetely in the orange zone.I would really appreciate some help.Regards,Benjamin",
                "Hello Benjamin,1) I think if you want one mesh  in OpenFOAM, so you need to create one mesh in Salome. I don't think you can \"fuse\" different meshes into one after export.2) The response is: one Solid byblock, knowing that they have then to be put together in a Compound. This can be done by using theOperations > Partitiontool orNew Entity > Build > Compound+Repair > Glue Faces.If you want a pure blocking geometry, you can check if it is OK for meshing withMeasures > Check Compound of Blocks.Then you can create Groups of parallel Edges (used to define different numbers of segments in the mesh through sub-meshes) usingOperations > Blocks > Propagate.3) You can try to split the opposite face of your block into a same number of sub-faces. Else you will need to split your block into 4 sub-blocks having each precisely 6 single Faces.Best regards,William",
                "OK thanks you very much, it helps a lot.About point 2, I have created one solid by block,  I think I manage to create a compound and glueing it.About point 3, is there an automatic way of splitting the face and after the blocks or do I have to use points and build manually the blocks?",
                "Here is the script",
                "Hi Benjamin,I have an idea how to make your mesh rather easy: w/o creating a complex blocking in Orange zone.The idea is to model Box zone + Orange zone as one box which is easy to mesh with hexa, an to create the groups corresponding to the 2 zones using Group On Filter.The attached script creates these two zones. It makes one box to make a mesh and another box to select hexas for 'Box' zone.St.Micheal",

                "Hi,So I play a little bit with the software, I have been able to mesh my case, but something failed in the simulation probably  due to the fact that my mesh is not orthogonal in some crucial parts.So I am trying to follow your idea of scaling the box in order to do another kind of mesh.I want to mesh something like the attached figure, except that I want a small box in the middle of the channel and not the whole column.",

If I use your (Saint Michael) technique for the box 1 scaled and mesh , how do I manage to set my boundary conditions on the box1 boundary?I understand I can filter out the part corresponding to the volume of the box, but in this case in the geometry I used for the mesh there isn't the group corresponding to the boundary of the box.And when I export the filtered part, does it export the groups that I used to set the boundary conditions?

                "Thanks, I think I get it.My actual situation is the one of the picture.I read the following threads without finding a solution.http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/259294913#163497672andhttp://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/878432222#362644314I tried to define submeshes on one edge and apply the hypotheses that the opposite should be the same.I tried also to define submeshes on a group created by propagate.But it appears that some edge when they are used for the mesh are liked shifted back (visible in the yellow circle).This doesn't appear logical to me if I understand how works the mesh module.(In the geometry module, the edges are perfectly parallel neither they are shifted in a way they shouldn't.",
                "As you use non-uniform node distribution, you face the issue of differently oriented edges. For me an easiest solution is to correctly define sub-meshes on each of edges of 3 orthogornal ridges of your domain and to usePropagation hypothesis: on each of these sub-meshes you define 'Wire Discretization' algo + 1D hyp you use now + 'Propagation on oposite side' additional hyp. Any 1D hypothesis should be assigned at the mesh (not sub-mesh) level, as far as I remember.To be precise: there are 4 ridges in each of 3 (X,Y,Z) directions, you define sub-meshes on ( edges of one of 4 parallel ridges) x ( 3 directions ).St.Michael",
                "It is exactly what I am trying to do! I spent a few hours trying to sort that out without any results.But it fails always like the picture I am posted. Honestly it seems to me to be a bug, I hope to be wrong!My hdf file is too large to post.Perhaps teh problem is linked to how I have built my geometry using boolean operations and extrusions. I could try to rebuild everything from scratch.",

                "Hi,So I went back to my problem, I link here the file:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19260564/Study4_b_withoutmesh.hdfI was full of hope... but it went not as I expected...1) The mesh is still not computing well, It was working with the propagation by nodes but when I add stretching in the inlet direction (submeshes  6,7,8  the last two should be redundant so the 6th should be enough), the problem appears again. I don't understand how to solve it or to debug it.2) Assuming I don't have the submeshes 6,7,8 the mesh is ok (just not streched in the inlet direction).I follow the procedure given by St Michael in this topic and it allows me to create the faces corresponding to the box \"Facesbox\", I create groups from the geometry for inlet oulet and channels walls. So I have the 4 boundaries I need.The problem is the mesh I have to export is \"Allwithoutbox\" created from mesh1 using a volume filter.  How can I export this filtered mesh with the boundaries that belong to the original \"mesh1\"?Thanks in advance, if I solve these points I am definitively ok for my project.Benjamin",
                "Hi Benjamin1) I wanted to propose to change the way you created geometry to assure all edges have same direction, I mean usage of extrusion. But then I decided to check if it helps  and created a script (attached) that creates your geometry. Finally I found that the way of geometry creation does not matter in this case. The problem seems to be in combination of Geometric Progression + Reversing of edges. As a workaround I used other hypothesis, \"Start and End Length\" which also creates geometric progression distribution but does not require Reversing edges as we can simply swap start and end lengths. Now the mesh is OK (run the script).2) To export everything except Box group you can simply remove elements of this group (pop-up menu of the group in Object Browser > Delete Groups with Contents)St.Michael",

                "HelloThanks for your hints. After all I have now a \"half\" model running. The best way (since I did not create the CAD drawing myself) was to explode everything into faces, remove the problematic ones, create them new out of adjacent edges, build new shell/solid and then try to mesh again. This took then several steps like this with always upcoming new problem faces... I also scaled it up to milimeters.Once repaired it, its cool to calculate around. Out of this maybe someone can help me with setting the boundary conditions. I have to restrict 6 DOFs. With the symmetry face I have 3 of them. How can I restrict the other 3 (1 rotational, 2 translational) without inducing stresses? My goal is just to calculate internal thermal stresses.CheersThomas",
                "Hello Steubi,In a solid model you need to restrict only 3 translational DOFs.  The rotational DOF's are implied.  So for half the model you would:1 Restrict the displacement in the plane that did the cutting, and (DX=0 if the cutting plane is YZ)2. Restrict the displacement in a direction orthogonal to it at the midplane of your sensor. (DZ = 0 on the XY plane) )3. Finally, restrict the 3rd orthogonal displacement for both the above planes. (DY = 0 ie Z-Axis is the axis of the center line)Since I do not have your model readily in front of me the above reference planes may need to be suitable changed in your case.Regards, JMB"

                "The plan is to create a neat hexahedral mesh on a geometry that consists of several rectangular cubic parts. So I expect the \"body fitting\" algorithm to do the job. Also I want to have different refinement levels on each of the geometry parts and make use of the so-called hanging nodes at the joining interface.\n\nI created the simple construct including \"main\" and \"secondary\" parts, as you can see in the attached screenshot. To define different cell sizes I use sub-meshes for the two parts.\n\nNow, the mesh can be generated without any errors. However, a few cells of polyhedron type are created right at the interface on the main part side. This is problematic as I can't successfully import the grid in the CFD solver.\n\nSo my question is: How can I get rid of these cells, or if the procedure I took is wrong, what is the correct procedure for generating mesh on a multi-body geometry?",
                "Update:\nIt's possible to get rid of the polyhedra by using the \"Split Volumes\" modification tool and defining a volume filter based on the geometry type polyhedron. This measure however converts the polyhedra to tetrahedra, which is again troublesome for the subsequent export to CFD solver. So, I correct my question: How to avoid getting such cells at the interface to begin with?",
                "HiI suggest creating your geometry other way. Don't create a partition but create a compound of your boxes instead.

This way the mesh, including sub-meshes, is created without the added polyhedra at the interface. However, it does introduce an internal face at the interface which cannot be assigned to a face group, since it would not require any boundary conditions. This would lead to subsequent issues in OpenFOAM.  \nI noticed the problem with compound mesh topologies has been reported before on the forums, e.g.https://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/910197920.However I could not find any working solution to this problem.  \nTo summarise my experience so far: \"Fuse\" and \"Partition\" merging parts can be used to create multi-part geometries. The former would not allow generating sub-meshes for individual parts and the latter leads to polyhedra at the interface of two parts. \"Compound\" however causes the above mentioned issue. Do you have any other ideas?",

To solve it try to use NETGENPlugin_NETGEN_2D instead of NETGENPlugin_NETGEN_2D3D.To specify meshing parameters, create and add NETGENPlugin_Hypothesis_2D.St.Michael",

For the 2 group I try the same but I need more refine in the leading_edge. I try the wire discretization - Distribution with table density but the result it isn't what I was waiting.

I have search a lot and tried a lot, but have not found the secret. The problem can be simplified by considering a box in a box. I would like to remove one face of the inner box so the volume in the big box and small box are one.I have joined the nested boxes together using FUSION. That is not what I want.I have joined them together using PARTITION. Then I EXPLODE the resulting partition and select only the parts I want leaving out the face between the two volumes. These selected parts I use to create another partition. If I select only faces, I get a result that has only 2d parts and I cannot mesh it for 3d. If I select faces and solids for the partition, I get two separate solids and it puts a face in that I did not select.I tried EXTRACT and REBUILD. When I select the face to extract it also extracts the solids on either side and the result rebuild is only 2d and will not properly mesh.Thank you for helping,Mark",

I had to learn to make the big box the main object in the partition and then the 5 faces of the small box the tool objects. I also learned I did not want to check the box \"keep shapes of lower type\". I also tried repair>shape processing. It found 3 or 4 things to fix. For whatever reason when I tried to create a group, there was no sub-shapes to select. So I did the partition directly - not using a group.I am having a problem that may or may not be important.Occasionally I get a window that pops up and says\"Fatal Error  Unknown exception\"When you click OK. you get another widow that says\"Fatal error  SIGSEGV 'segmentation violation' detected.

I have defined a GetDictGroups function whose code is at the end of the message. To use it:d_groups = GetDictGroups(Mesh_1)Mesh_1.RemoveGroup(d_groups[\"Group1\"])Beware, you can have different types of groups with the same name. In this case, add for instance gr_type==smesh.FACE when calling GetDictGroups to have the groups of faces.And if your mesh is the result of a Code_Aster conversion, you can add the paramater strip=True, because Code_Aster adds blanks at the end of the group names.def GetDictGroups(mesh, gr_type = None, strip=True):# récupère les groupesl_groups =  mesh.GetGroups()l_group_names =  mesh.GetGroupNames()d_groups = {}for group, name in zip(l_groups, l_group_names):if gr_type is None or (group.GetType()) == gr_type:if strip:name = name.strip()d_groups[name] = groupreturn d_groupsChristophe",

C1A is a whole face of of the C1 body, while C2_A should be the projection of C1_A on C2 body (let's imagin that C2 is bigger than C1)What i have done to obtain the C2_A region was to use the partition comand, using the C1_A face as tool: the problem here is that the new created item (PARTITION_1) is outside the C2 body in the model tree, so totally useless. Is there a way to create this region on the C2 body, making that it will be still under the same parent? I haveto create at least 12 of these couplings on my model, so it could be really useful to find a solution.",

Now I want to add a chamfer, a radius, an hole, or ,as in my case, I want to divide in two or more parts an existing face. At each operation, Salome creates a new geometrical object in the model tree, so the mesh associated to the parent object does not reflects the changes that exists on each child. This lead to a big consuming of time if I need to modify the original shape, because I have to recreate the whole mesh from scratch at each modification in the geometrical object.I'm a mechanical designer and I use windows-based CAD modeler daily, and all of them operates in the way that I was describing: every operation on a solid is contained on the solid itself, and this is very useful to mantain faces IDs, constrains etc. I don't know if SALOME works in this way due to a limitation of the kernel or it is a choice of software design, but I don't feel this is the good way.",

                "Hi.Could you write how you estimate mesh quality? I know that one way is based on analysis results (run second analysis with refined mesh to check if the value of displacement/strain/stress differs significantly from the value acquired from first analysis). There are tools in Salome to estimate mesh quality before analysis i.e. element aspect ratio, warp, skew and so on. How do you use them on everyday basis? Are there any limits which you do not exceed (warp, ratio etc.)?",
                "Hello Krzysztof,You can display such things in the GUI usingcontrols.To activate them, select your mesh, then right-click in the 3D windows, then open theControlssub-menu and then you have some options.You can also plot a histogram going into theDistributionsub-menu.To make more advanced operations (eg. put all cells above a certain aspect ratio in a mesh group), you can use scripts. You have lots of examples in the documentation (Help > Mesh module > User's Guide, thenPython interface > Quality controls).Hope this helps,Best regardsWilliam",
                "I understand how the tools work. Again, I'd like to get an answer from someone's experience about any limits which one don't exceed. For example, do you refine mesh when aspect ratio of 30% of elements is between 1:2 and 1:1,5 and the rest is above (near 1:1)?",

In addition, on simple cases, refining the mesh at \"bad\" cell locations didn't really improve the mesh quality (actually, meshes using Netgen algos are quiet good without doing anything).I think the best is simply to use a script from the documentation to put \"bad\" cells in a mesh group so as to display them in the 3D window and to think about how to improve the mesh.William",

I am confused by the result.When I use a structure grid solver which written by myself, the result is very good, but when I use the same grid in EDGE by DES, the result is very poor., I must submission my report to my advisor befor 20  OCT. , I worry about the deadline very much! Please help me.Usually DES requires a spatial resolution at least 150 Y+ in the streamwise direction, and a Y+ first cell prism layer in the order of 0.8. The time scale for the unsteady computation will have to be scaled to these values in accordance. But can I ask you a question? Are you tryng to perfrom a DES analysis for a 2D case right?Because DES is an high 3 dimensional model so using this turbulence model in a 2d case would certainly lead to error due to an inadeguate phisical modeling.If you are using a 2D grid the best you can perform is an URANS case with an DRSM model!"

Then the whole thing extuded out.I know I have to use block decomposition for this since I require 4-sided faces. So I built a model as shown in the right image, made up of the different 4-sided regions. When I apply a hex mesh to this I get the different meshing structures I require in each block which is great, but the mesh does not connect well across the boundaries between the ogrid blocks and larger hGrid blocks. I guess because I have meshed each block as a separate entity.So my question is this - how do I mesh the whole thing as one so that my mesh connects well across boundaries. From what I have read I think I have to use submeshes setting restrictions on how the mesh should behave across block interfaces. But when I try to do this it only seems to change what is happening on one side or the other.I built my geometry in Ansys since I am more familiar with that and for CFX meshing I can define my blocks as regions of influence to the overall structure when meshing to do what I desire. Can I do a similar thing in Salome? Do I need to explicitly tell the program that my structer is a composite structure made up of the individual blocks for this to work?Any help would be appreciated, sorry if this is too simple/vague a question I am asking!Best regardsSusan",

I will give it a try though and see what I get. I may end up using an unstructured mesh in the regions outside the disk too since my rectangular domain is so tight around the disk and Im getting such stretched elements.Can you shed any light on getting the elements to match up across block edges?

Any technique? Any tricks of the trade anybody knows?I wish I could mesh one region at a time, starting from the innermost one and have the outside region keep matching the inner one at the interface and keep increasing the size of the elements, and so on. but I am not sure how to do this or whether at the end I would end up with a \"single\" mesh as expected by Elmer.Is it possible to mesh the wires first? individually? and then produce an overall 2d mesh based on those wires?Any advice would be appreciated.Thanks,gsal",
                "Hello Germán,The mesh can be configured from 1D edges to 2D domains. For example when you create the mesh, or edit the mesh, (there are tool buttons to create and edit the mesh), there are tab pages in the popped dialog from 3D, 2D, 1D and 0D. Starting from the 1D page, 1D edges can be discretised by segment size, segment number or even using expressions to control the profile of the segment sizes.Then to the 2D page, 2D mesh preference can be set to, e.g. quadrangle, and the segment number can be based on the already configured 1D edges.For a 2D model, it is done and press the Compute button to see if it meets your requirement. If not, edit the mesh configuration again.On the other hand, if you use Python script to produce the mesh, you can refer to a small example,http://code-saturne.blogspot.com/2010/02/cfd-example-laminar-flow-along-2d.htmlI hope it helps. Good luckBest regards,http://code-saturne.blogspot.com/",

And when I try to fix the outer one, it un-does what I did in the inner one, etc.Or if I try to mesh the various parts independently, then they don't match at the interfaces. and they will probably not be exported as a single mesh, anyway (as expected by Elmer).I wish one could set wire discretisation on a line-by-line basis BEFORE getting to the meshing part. I think gmsh allows to set a \"critical length\" at the time of creating a line, for example; I think ANSYS allows for this too.is it clear? is it correct? or am I missing something?

These are global algos and hypos.It is possible to define the sub-meshes in the mesh (menu Mesh/Create Sub-mes). The geometry of the sub-mesh will be meshed by algorithms defined at sub-mesh definition (local algos and hypos).So, if you need to have a denser mesh on a geom edge or some edges, you should define a sub-mesh on that edge (or a wire, or a group of edges) to specify other algo+hyp.If you want to start meshing from the inner part and then pass to the outer ones, your steps can be following: 1) explode your Partition into solids 2) create a mesh on your Partition without any algos 3) define a sub-mesh on your inner part, here you define algos+hypos, then compute the mesh 4) define a sub-mesh on your outer part (algos+less dense hyp), compute the mesh (the 1st sub-mesh remains intact), etc.BR, St. Michael",

                "Hello,I have a import geometry problem.I came from Ansys/Icem where my model was produced by using FEM-calculations. Now I wanted to import the deformed shape saved in the many FEM-knots as geomety-faces in Salome.This is done already by using python scripting! Now I have nearly 1400 little faces in my geometry-tree which all together repesent a symmetry-suface. I want to merge them or make them into one real surface without the Information of the many faces coupled with, see pictureTo make a solid of theese faces is not the problem (rotational copies are required), but meshing the volume. When I try to mesh it the internal memory (4GB is present) gets over level and uses harddisk. And then nothing is going on more...What is the solution for that problem?? I remeber ICEM, where it was possible to merge the little faces after converting them to so calleed \"faceted faces\"..Thanks for help!",

That results in a not changeable amount and arrangement of the surficial faces. which is not deired, see picture.But Ok, to get at least ONE mesh, that could be accepted. But now the problem is to project the node-number and -arrangements of the 4 surface borders onto the 4 underneath lying egdes. I have no idea how that works..Best regards,Stefan",
                "HiI propose the following solution.As I see in your last picture, your geometry looks suitable for hexahedral meshing if we consider the top composite surface as one face.\"Hexahedron (i,j,k)\" algo won't work with such a geometry, so a solution is to use it without geometry. It remains to make a 2D mesh on your geometry, which then will be copied into another mesh where you'll be able to use \"Hexahedron (i,j,k)\".How to make quadrangular mesh on lateral faces of the geometry. The only way I see is to use Pattern mapping.1) To make quadrangular mesh on the bottom face using \"Quadrangle (Mapping)\" algo, taking care to have same number of segments on the bottom edges as on the top ones. For that, to make submeshes on the bottom face and the bottom edges.2) To make a pattern file from the bottom submesh: menu Modifications/Pattern Mapping, click \"New\", select the bottom submesh as \"Mesh or SubMesh\", click \"Save...\".3) Modify the saved pattern file to fit to topology of the lateral faces. It is necessary to add \"key-points\" corresponding to multiple geom vertices on a \"composite\" side of a quasi-quadrilateral face. The format of the pattern file is simple, see its description in help of Pattern Mapping dialog. In attachement, see a pattern file modified by me. The initial pattern file was taken from a face meshed 5x5. I changed!!! Indices of 4 key-points:0 5 10 15into!!! Indices of key-points:0 5 10 15 1 2 3 4This modified pattern is suitable to apply to a quasi-quadrilateral face whose \"composite\" side consists of 5 edges. You have to create 2 pattern files, one for a pair of lateral faces.4) Load a pattern file and apply it to your lateral faces.5) Merge coincident nodes.Then you copy your 2D mesh into another mesh, add \"Hexahedron (i,j,k)\" algo, compute and voila you have a hexahedral mesh!St. Michael",
                "Hey, sorry I had much to do do the last days..I have successfully saved the patternFile of the buttom submesh. At first I want to mesh the small lateral faces. So I modified the file in the way that all nodes on one small edge are keypoints. But then, I have some problems to load the modified pattern file on the face.You can see the original pattern file as well as the modified one in the attachement-zip.Can you see what did I wrong?best regards,Stefan",

For \"Face\" I select the buttom-Face. As \"Vertex\" i select the Vertex corresponding to the \"0\"-point in the file. I've no idea what the error could cause..Stefan",
                "As \"Face\" you should select one of lateral faces. If you load the pattern with key points on the short side, then you select a short lateral face (front left in2D_mesh.png). If the key point #1 shown by Pattern Mapping dialog is at bottom then as \"Vertex\" you should select a bottom vertex of the selected face. Check in \"Preview\" box. If a previewed mesh is ugly, check in \"Reverse order of key-points\" box.St. Michael",
                "I have just realized that to have good patterns for neighboring lateral faces it is not enough to change key points of the pattern loaded from the bottom side as I said. This way we get 2D mesh on lateral faces but number of vertical layers will be different but it must be same.So proceed as i said with long lateral faces but for the short faces we need to make a patters with equal nb of segments on all edges. I'd create and mesh a rectangle and take a pattern from it and then add key points to it.St. Michael",
                "Ok, I was able to adjust the pattern to the long lateral face. You can see it in the picture. I would like more a more equally distribution of the nodes of the projected pattern, but a hexa-meshed geometry would be great at all.But when I want to apply the patternMapping dialog, nothing happens. I thought with patternMapping we can create submeshes of the lateral faces.But after applying there is no lateral face submesh at all. What exactly should happen by creating an pattern of a lateral face?Thanks,Stefan",

My channel flow should have the same cell distribution as the diffuser inlet.When I mesh the geometry in Salome everything works OK with \"automatic hexahedralization\" but I can't seem to use a viscous sublayer hypothesis to create viscous sublayers. I worked around this with a 1D submesh but I would like to get the viscous layers hypothesis working.The viscous sublayers work on the channel flow with no problems, but when I try to apply them to the diffuser I get 4 errors that say\"Invalid input mesh. Can't build pentahedral mesh on viscous layers\" and another error that says\"Viscous layers builder: Wrongly meshed EDGE 123\".I have attached a python script of my mesh, however I noticed that it generates an error in Salome (I am using v 6.4.0). Below is a link to the hdf of my geometry and mesh.https://www.dropbox.com/s/u5bcv0vo18ejsqf/visc_layers_diffuser.hdfI was wondering if anyone knew how I might solve this problem, and create a diffuser mesh with viscous sublayers?Thank you very much,Adam",

                "Hi All,I found a solution to my riddle... Giventhis threadthat expands the understanding on the workings of \"distribution with analytic density\" on \"Number of Segments\" hypothesis, i made the following reasoning:1) The integral ( I )  of the analytic density function ( f(t) ) can be expressed as:  I = F(1) - F(0)   , where F(t) is the antiderivative of f(t)2) The nth node on the distribution ( xn ) must follow: integral from 0 to xn of f(t) dt = n * I / N , where N is the number of segments. Then we can express it as: F(xn) - F(0) = n/N*I3) Combining step 1) and 2) we can find the following expression: F(xn) = n/N*F(1) + (1 - n/N)*F(0) ... so, knowing the desired xn node distribution, its a matter of finding the function F(t) that respects the given relation.4) The desired node distribution can be obtained from the dimensionless summation of a geometric series: xn =  a* (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) / (a* (1 - r^N)/(1 - r) ) => xn = (1 - r^n)/(1 - r^N) = (r^n - 1)/(r^N - 1)5) Finally, testing some functions on the relation 3) and comparing with 4) it can be found that f(t) = 1/(a*t +b) where a = r^N - 1 and b=1 . By integration F(t) = 1/a * ln(a*t + b).Answer:f(t) = 1 / ( (r^N - 1)*t + 1) = 1 / (C*t  + 1) , where C is a constant.Even more, you can have a symmetric distribution combining the expression on 5)  with its mirrored self as:f(t) = 1/((r^N - 1)*t + 1) + 1/( -(r^N - 1)*(t - 1) +1)Which you ensure that the fastest change in node ratio is r.Hope this help others with same or similar riddles.Abraham."

                "Hi Edward!Thank you very much\nfor your comment!I had indeed some\nproblems generating the geometry. Especially the partition sometimes failed,\nmeaning that after partitioning some faces were missing (?!). I will outline\nshortly what I did and I would highly appreciate your comments on my approach…Generate a sphere\nof radius 1Scale the sphere by\nx:y:z = 6:1:1 to generate the prolate spheroidGenerate a sphere\nof radius 150 (for the farfield)Cut out the prolate\nspheroid from the farfield sphereCut off half of the\nresulting sphere (by using a large block) to consider only one half of the\nproblem (for symmetry reasons)Generate two disks\nand use these disks to partition the half sphere into 4 spherical piecesExplode the\nresulting geometry to get all faces and edgesWhile the explode\nfunction works perfectly fine for the faces, it seems to generate more edges\nthan necessary. In fact, some edges are generated which seem not to exist\n(meaning they are not visible even if I use ‘show only’ and ‘fit all’). Is that\na bug or a feature?Due to this issue,\nI exported the geometry to a STEP file and then imported it again. Don’t know\nif that makes sense but obviously it didn’t solve the problem…However, in the\nmeantime I think I found the problem: the OCC error seems to come from a\ngeometric progression I applied to all the internal edges to generate a proper\nboundary layer. With this hypothesis, I’m not able to generate the volume mesh\n(OCC exception error). However, when I change the hypothesis to e.g. a scaled\ndistribution, everything works perfectly fine. I read the user guide section\nabout the geometric progression and searched this forum but didn’t come up with\na satisfying answer for this issue. Do you have any idea, why geometric\nprogression does not work? For me it is the most convenient way to define a\nboundary layer (define first cell height, e.g. 1e-5 and growth ration, e.g.\n1.2)…case-file:https://gofile.io/?c=kuGspgpicture of the case:https://ibb.co/bBRSFT3Best regards,Rouven",

Wrong number of wires: 2\"On the other hand, if I set the lateral dimension of two sheets the same, I do not get this error. Also, if I use other free volume meshing like Netgen meshing, I do not get any error message, and the meshes between the two Boxes are nicely connected. From this, I can make a crude guess that the error comes from the two faces from each Box that make contact clashing during hex meshing.I cannot use non-hex mesh, because my goal is to simulate very flat sheets (for example, 2mm x 2mm x 50nm sheet), and other meshes fail due to this very high anisotropy.This is a very simple geometry meshing, but I've been quite struggling and am not able to come up with any answer. I would greatly appreciate any suggestion.",

            "discussion": [
                "Hi to all and thanks  in advance for taking time.I want to do mesh creation with salome for later use with OpenFOAM. The case is a valve with a quite small annular gap, depending on how far the locking piece is inserted into the valve. Because of parameter variations I intend to perform the task with a python script.Till now, I created severeal points (MakeVertex), and depending on if the line is curved or straight edges (MakeInterpol, MakeEdge), which where used to create faces (MakeFaceWires), from which a volume each was created (MakePrismVecH). Then the volumes are partitioned (MakePartition([listofvolumes])).I already figured out how to get all the edges for applying hypotheses later and how to set up the groups of 'boundary' faces for later use in OF.The problem I'm facing is that I couldn't use 'viscous layer' because the annular gap is so small that the layers will overlap, which gives an error. Instead I tried to get the near wall layer manually (sections 1 and 3, see attached picture).Question: Is there a way to mesh section 4 with Hexahedron mesh?It seems that whatever I try, section 4 always has 6 edges in x-y-plane, which is 2 too much. I would be really thankful if someone could give me a hint on how to tackle this problem.Martinps. I really hope this is the right place to ask, didn't find any forum guidelines yet...",
                "Sorry, I read several times your explanations, and I still don't get it. I can't understand your geometry nor the problems.On the picture, I see only 3 edges for the section 4, but if you want to mesh it using quadrangles (2D), you'll have to divide it manually trough geometric section. Depending on your division (ex. lines between center of edges and center of triangle), you will be able to mesh each part with quadrangles and then in hexahedrons. However I don't understand why hexas would solve any trouble you face.",
                "Thanks for taking time anyway, I'll try it againattached is another sketch of the case in general. you can see the valve, which consists of a nozzle and a locking piece. it's axially symmetric. the both form an annular gap, where the gas flows through. I'm supposed to do multiple simulations for different positions of the locking piece on the x-axis and therefore for different thicknesses of the gap.the first intention was to get sepperate wall layers on the inner contour of the nozzle and on the contour of the locking piece. this seems not possible for small annular gaps, because the wall layers would overlap then. that's why I thought why not create the layers manually? starting from the inlet (pipe) till they would meet. these are sections 1 and 3 in the previous picture. section 4 shall cover the annular gap and if possible also make use of the Quadrangle parameter reduced, but this is another point.but I'm not able to do so because the edge between 4, 1, 2 and 3 consists of three edges, so I'm always getting an error like \"meshing algorithm failed, face x had 6 instead of 4 edges\"if I could solve this, you would have the nozzle meshed. but there's still no wall layer on the locking piece in section 5... I must add that this is the first cfd simulation I'm doing on my own and so I'm not entirely shure if I really need what I'm trying to get, but since the speed of the gas flow will reach transsonic velocitys, I guess the mesh should be 'correct' especially at the wall and preferable adaptable to shock fronts for example, but this could be done with the number of segments on edges...I hope I could give you a deeper inside in what I think my problem is and thanks for helping,Martin",
                "oh, and what do you mean by 'geometric section'? this sounds interesting to...",
                "Hi Martinbut I'm not able to do so because the edge between 4, 1, 2 and 3\nconsists of three edges, so I'm always getting an error like \"meshing\nalgorithm failed, face x had 6 instead of 4 edges\"\"Quadrangle (mapping)\" algorithm is able to unite continuous edges into one side to have needed 4 sides of a quadrilateral face (see attached picture). To profit from this feature, ensure that your 3 edges lie on a line.St.Michael",
                "You are right! I tried it myself and it works. But unfortunatly I'm still not done:I observed the following:- creating the faces and partition them and meshing with \"Quadrangle\" and \"Wire_discretization\" works.- creating the faces and extrude them and partition the volumes and meshing with \"Hexahedron\" and \"Quadrangle\" and \"Wire_discretization\" results in the following error:p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }\"Hexa_3D_3\" failed on SOLID #84. Error: Algorithm failed. Error in _QuadFaceGrid::LoadGrid():1063where SOLID #84 is section 4.since the mesh seems to be generated, I could ignore this error, but sadly import in OpenFOAM doesn't work.this is the error I get:UNV conversion with ideasUnvToFoam(I use salome v.6.3.0)I also tried meshing completly without 3D algorithm. meshing went fine, but then conversion also doesn't work.however, I could still just mesh the partitioned faces and extrude the mesh, but the problem here is that I have know idea how to get the face groups for boudary creation... is there a way to explode a mesh into faces?this time I attach the script used to generate this, at least for me, tricky geometry. maybe this way it's easier to find a solution.BUT, thanks for your help so far!Martin",

Though both results have continuous curvature none is symmetrical to the XZ plane despite symmetrical coordinates.Failing at that I tried a workaround with tangents but couldn't generate a satisfactory result too.Has anyone came across the same difficulties or am I simply missing something and there is a simple solution for my problem?Thanks  in advanceSven",

But It seems you want to build more specipic shape, then 3-order spline.I can advance 2 way for your task:1. If you know analitical equation for your curve, try to use more points.2. Your curve is a result of intersect two surfaces, isn't it? Maybe, it would be easier to create that surfaces and then create a curve as Line-Intersection.",

Your file is a feasible solution to my problem but not the one i was looking for.I want to build up many symmetrical cross sections into a filling. All of them are merely described by the three (four) points I had in my file (Up, Right, (Left = -Right), Down).All the other software I used so far (e.g. Rhino, FreeCAD, Blender) hadn't had such a problem but I really like Salome and was just wondering if it is a application error by me or a bug because building a closed edge should produce uniformly solutions regardless of the point sequence. In this case the tangent of the curve at lower and upper point should be OY automatically without giving vectors.Sven",

For Interpolate  curve we can choose start and end tangent, and for your closed curve for one case start and end are Up point, for other case  Down point.Unfortunately,  I don't know how tangents of internal points are calculating, maybe, you can find it in source code.I'm not sure about what shape do you want to build, but, for example, when we build a line, we need exactly 2 points. For building the parabola we need 3 points, and 2 points are not enought, we can create many parabolas thru 2 points, and soon...When I set tangent vectors OY and -OY, I get symmetric shape, which is very different from your one's. Are you sure 3 points are enought?Also, you can build filling from half edges and then mirrow a surface to get symmetric tonnel.Irina"

Currently I need the following feature for my exporter:I need to list all edges(actually node pairs forming them) that are internal in the mesh. Illustration:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25635148/InternalEdges.pngEdges in group 1 can be selected via Create Group or in any other way. They actually exist because are one boundary geometry I built the mesh with. But I need to list all edges that are internal to the mesh(marked as 2).

I simply open a connections from a terminal in UBUNTU with:ssh -X user@domainand launch SALOME on the server (I use the same procedure with NETGEN). Anyway, I experience a problem with SALOME: all geometrical objects are created (I see them in Object Browser) but I can't display them. It's not a question of background or lines colours, SALOME works from the usual server terminal (SUSE 9.1). Is something about ssh options or something else?Thanks for you help, regards.",

Just curious, is it that not all versions get released?...just wondering.@vaina:I know you are using Linux only.  VNC should be available on both of your machines, the remote server and your client.The thing is that some 3D rendering applications use hardware acceleration (the local graphics card, GPU) for better performance instead of trying to achieve the same thing through special software (MESA, for example) and giving sequential and complex instructions to a regular CPU.Because you are using X forwarding, the instructions to your display are being issued at the server (intended for its own graphics card) and being transported by ssh all the way to your client (with a different graphics card).  So, this not always work.In any case, my suggestion of using VNC was to let the X commands be executed locally at the server and then just bring a picture of the image to your client...this is what VNC does.Sometimes it is possible to tell an application to stop using \nhardware acceleration; but you need to provide it with software, \ninstead, like MESA...while this makes the software work in more places and even remotely, performance is not as good.gsal",

For preparing some extremely simple study I tried to generate a pseudo-2D-mesh, i.e. height equals one layer of cells. Using the spacing parameter at the same f(t) as the height of the geometry did the trick of a single layer mesh.\n\nBUT: It seems the mesh is somewhat displaced. At least for a small part the positions of the mesh and of the geometry differ (see image attached). For all other parts of the geometry it is fine, but in this section the mesh cells seem to be shifted to the left by one cell.\n\nDoes anybody have an idea where that behaviour does come from? If you can deduce an OSI layer 8 error, please try to explain the error in a comprehensible way. Are there ideas how one can correct that behaviour?\n\nThanks for any answers in advance!\n\nCheers,\nBernhard",

I amcompletelynew to this procedure (and FEM in general), so I am wondering if somebody could please take a look at my .step file and recommend an approach.I have 2 different .step files - both represent stranded cables, although one is twisted and one is straight (I originally assumed the straight cable would work since it is a simpler geometry).A link to the straight cable is here:https://www.dropbox.com/s/51svhhpl20a4iee/Cable_Total.zipAnd a link to the twisted cable is here:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/eylkf71r0ywhybv/fd3UxFaaJYMy eventual goal is to have a single mesh of the cable which can be imported into Elmer for further analysis, but partitioned such that Elmer \"sees\" the outer 24 wires as a separate \"body\" (they need to represent steel cables while the inner wires should be copper).Any assistance you can provide would be much appreciated.Best Regards,Courtney",

I deduced that to use NETGEN 1D-2D-3D it's necessary to limit max size of element. Note that while computing this mesh, SALOME occupied ~4.5 Gb of RAM.I tried to use \"Extrusion 3D\" algorithm. In case of Cable_Total.stp it's much faster than NETGEN, though it's a bit harder to correctly assign all needed algos and hypotheses. I wrote a script doing this automatically and got a mesh on Cable_Total.stp.But when I tried to apply my script to 3ft wire.STEP, 3D meshing failed because 1) incorrect 2D mesh (different mesh on opposite faces of a wire, which can be fixed in principle by script correction) and 2) there are solids including several wires, which is fatal for use of \"Extrusion 3D\" algorithm.3ft wire.STEP can't be meshed using NETGEN 1D-2D-3D, because faces of solids, which compose one wire, are overlapping.

It is not a problem at all for the strait wire. For the stwisted wire, it can be difficult, but I created a Python function able to create the middle spline of two spline. This allows to extract the middle edge of the 'pipes' (the wires), so as to extrude newly created block faces along this spline (see the picture enclosed).Courtney, I would like to be sure of the file to use about the twisted wire. Because from your link there are several possibilities, and the one I downloaded is not only twisted, but bended. And, it contains intersecting volumes. So it is obvious that for this case the structured mesh is not possible. Else, there is no problem.Are you interested? And what file to use for the twisted wire? Also, what number of cells do you expect? Or what maximum cell size do you want?Best regards,William",

I have created a separate folder in dropbox to share the files from, so hopefully the links below will lead to the correct files.My ultimate goal is to obtain a mesh of the twisted wire, with a separate \"body\" (in Elmer) for the outer and inner wires as mentioned above.

On the picture you can see the intersected solids in red, and the 'stand-alone' solids in green. A solution could be to copy the stand-alone solids so as to replace the intersecting ones by other ones not intersecting (and to rebuilt the central wire which is straight by simple extrusion). Your geometry will be sligtly modified, but very similar to the original (as you can see in the picture), and compatible with structured mesh.Is it OK for you?Best regards,WilliamPS: I have no experience with Elmer export, but I think it won't be a problem...",

Many a software programs when encountering older data files will automatically offer to upgrade a copy of it to the current version.  CodeAster has lacked the capability to recognize command file compatibilty for years, in-spite of my bring it to the development team notice.  It is the cumulative lack of basic rules in the version upgrade process that cause me to be critical of the software not any individual in particular.  Although what I have written about is CodeAster's incapacity, when combined with Salome's lack of backward compatibility with at least one older generation of CodeAster, it compounds the work an analyst has to perform.  Maybe this ensures job security at some departments!Since CodeAster / Salome developer teams are partners in this marriage I hope either or both will take notice of this and use it as a lesson learned for 'best practices'.Regards, JMB",

I would like to run this mesh script multiple times (concurrently if possible) to generate many mesh files based on varying parameters. I can have multiple copies of the mesh script and JSON file in different directories if necessary.My issue is how to do this properly with salome-2014. I have read the documentation and looked in the forums; but I'm confused. My salome-2014 is installed in a directory that has two folders: appli_V7_3_0  and V7_3_0. In the appli directory there are multiple run* files: runAppli, runSalomeScript, runSalome, etc. Which of these files do I use to run my python script and how do I do that? I don't need any of the other salome services besides the geom and meshing ones.Currently, I'm using: runAppli -t -k myscript.py and doing a:import osfrom killSalomeWithPort import killMyPortkillMyPort(os.getenv('NSPORT'))at the end of my script file. Is this best usage?I was previously using runSalomeScript with just the script filename afterward; but when starting up multiple calls to this, I was getting bizarre meshing errors. If I run only a single meshing script at a time, the mesh is created fine. Can the salome system create only a single mesh at a time on a given system?",

If I build a partition and I want to fuse all resulting solids (after exploding tha partition itself into solids), in order to obtain a single solid with a larger number of faces, I have to fuse two solids at a time. This is an annoying and easy-to-mistake operation, in case of a large number of sub-solids. Am I correct? Is there any alternative procedure?",

It removes the doubled faces between neighbour solids and if two solids share the same face, they are mechanically connected.There is just one rule (I see you already took care of it): The doubled faces have to have 100% the same size, otherwise your shell can't be closed.Regards,Robert",

Sometimes faces not belong together will be rebuild as one face and that causes these problems. You can figure such errors out by exploding the solid and measuring the faces for thier number of edges.But you better not use an already damaged solid further. You never know, if there's no bug remaining.If I had to build such blades, I would try to get access to the edges of the intercecting faces (parallel in x-direction) and use them to build two \"filling\" to get the whole blade as one solid (except the sharp top end).Or do you really need your blade consist of several pieces:-?",

Indeed, since Salome 5.1.4 and thanks to a terrific improvement due to Christian Caremoli, you can now customize the menubar of salome and of geom module. For the moment, you can only add functionalities into a \"Tools/Plugins\" menu for salome and into a \"New Entity/Other\" menu for GEOM. As far as I know, it is not implemented for other modules.To play with plugins, you must define a SALOME_PLUGINS_PATH variable which contain the directories in which the plugins python files can be found. For instance, just define SALOME_PLUGINS_PATH to one directory in which you copy the fileshttp://files.salome-platform.org/cea/adam/salome/scripts/salome_plugins.pyhttp://files.salome-platform.org/cea/adam/salome/scripts/geom_plugins.pyLaunch salome, open a study, an item \"Tools/Plugins/About plugins\" should appear. You can test it, it only launches a message dialog boxActivate GEOM module, an item \"New Entity/Other/Fuse all solids\" should appear. To test it, you have to select a geom shape to proceed, give a name, click on OK and it should do the job. Please, note that the dump / restore study works with this new added functionality but, of course, the generated python script contains the \"atomic\" calls to usual geompy features.Any feedback / remark about this facility is welcome.Regards, Erwan.",

So I decided to open a new file using the same session (if that is what one would call it) and tried it again, but the \"Other\" option in \"New entity\" is not even shown, in this second Salome window!Perhaps one can conclude that:a) The plugin works ONLY for the first geom window that has been opened.b) Even if the plugin option \"Other -> Fuse all solids\" is shown in the \"New entity\" menu, it is not guaranteed to work if the geom window is not the first (and freshly) opened window.Maybe this will help in improving the robustness of this and other valuable plugins.  I have attached screen pics of the two scenarios as evidence of the anomaly.Regards,JMBPS: Would you kindly verify if you can duplicate my observations 1 ~ 3.",

The best is to put touching geometries in a single geometrical object (a compound) and to make sure shared shapes are fused together, usingRepair > Glue Facesin 3D orRepair > Glue Edges/Sewingin 2D.Then, you can create geometrical groups (New Entity > Group > Create Group) or extract sub-shapes (New Entity > Explode) to distinguish different areas. Once in the Mesh module, you can create mesh groups directly from them (Mesh > Create Groups from Geometry). Then, your solver should be able to distinguish several regions in your mesh.The second way is to create several meshes and to create sub-meshes (Mesh > Create Sub-mesh) on shared shapes and using theProjection(1D-)2Dalgorithm or theUsing Existing 2D Elementsalgorithm.

                "Hello @all,I succeeded in building an (concrete) wall armed with (steel) wires inSalomé's geometry module, even though they are quadratic at the moment due to problems with meshing of cylindrical objects. See attached image. A somewhat sensible meshing is obtainable with the NetGen 1D-2D-3D algorithm bySalomé's meshing application, after building a compound of the contributing shapes (defined as groups: wall outline plus individual rectangular steel rods, created as multi-translates) and partioning this again in order to have the mesh obey the internal faces.As I want to do some heat-spread calculations on this object inElmer(chosen for its support of multicore CPUs) I'd need to export the mesh to it. But this requires the possibility to attribute boundary conditions to faces and bodies contained in the complete model volume.To my understanding a UNV mesh export principally would do the work. But the mesh conversion toolunv2gmshthat should translate named boundaries and sub-shapes only seems to find just one group in the mesh. So I am somewhat stunned how to proceed from this point to achieve the interfacing between the programs.Could someone please point me into the right direction?Kind regards,Peter",

My first trial'sdid not succeed due shell was so thin that Netgen could not make mesh,... I'am currently testing and trying to find outwhy volume created from two spehere's, one bigger and one smaller causes surface to break,...... it can be realated accurancy,... surgace is broken before meshing at geometry module and can be seenas surface is not smooth when shadeing on. Some how smaller sphere inside bigger one is time timebigger than bigger???To get separated bodyes you must have groups both geometry and same groups created to inside mesh youwill export as *.unv.   Salome will readi open command *.unv correctly.I had same problem whit you but reason was that there was error while meshing caused by too thin volumeand Salome hide that error. I could see that Netgen as well from salome terminal session where netgen response is seenas well. this error caused that there was not multiple bodyes instead just one.jonijoni"

This is because of a NETGEN bug that it defines edge discretization by dividing an edge into 1000 samples where it checks element size. This causes problem if the element size at some sample is smaller than a 1/1000 of edge length.It is possible to workaround this bug by dividing the \"too long\" edge into halves. I did this workaround and the refinement became OK, nonetheless a 2D mesh near the edge was invalid.  I got a valid 2D mesh only by applying 3D algorithm and 3D Viscous Layers.Best regardsEdward",

As far as the viscous layer behavior around sharp corners it is interesting the option of 3D meshing and then take only the symmetry plane face.It would be nice to have an option to \"share\" the sharp corners (say over an user defined value of degrees e.g. 60º), between an user defined number of nodes (3 on each edge, for example), the resulting viscous layers would be skewed to a certain degree, but the overall size growth would be a little less extreme, and aspect ratios could be kept under contorl (possibly).Thanks to the community for the help!"

Then I create 4 \"points\" (the first one is the origin, the last one is at x=1.0 m and the other two are at the exact position I want the supports to be). With the four points I create a \"Wire\" which I use to \"Extrude along Path\". This way I have a rectangular \"Pipe\".Second way  - I create a \"box\" (with the dimensions I want), then create \"Lines\" which represent the supports, and then \"Build Compound\" with the Box and both lines (I am not sure if the resulting compound is a solid or not).Is it correct any of them? Is there an easier way to do this?Then I have problems with the mesh and using Code_Aster, but I want to solve this problem first.Thanks in advance,JayJ",
                "Hello,What you can do is to create separatelly the rectangle and the prisms (they should be of typeSolid, notCompound), then to put them all into a \"partition\", that is: select them, go toOperations > Partitionand click onApply and Close.Like this you should have a compound in which are both supports and the bar in which where added contact lines.You can then mesh directly this partition or extract sub-solids usingNew Entity > Explode.I enclose a study dump made with Salome 7.3.0.Best regards,William",
                "HelloWilliam,Thanks for your reply.The python script attached didn't work for me. I import it and \nnothing happens (I have some other scripts and when I  import them the \ngeometry appears, but when I use yours it does not. I use Salome 6.3.0, \nmaybe that's the problem.)Since I can't import the script, I am not sure if what I did is correct, so here I explain it:Create aBox(New entity - Primitive - Box), create twoRectangular Face(New entity - Primitive - Rectangle) and place them where I want them to be, select these three objects andOperation - Partition - Apply&Close. After that, aPartition_1is created. Is that correct?Then I have another question with the mesh. In order to use the lines (lower edges of the rectangles) as supports (imposing DX,DZ = 0.0), is it correct to create groups (New Entity - Group - Create, and select the second option -edge- inShape Type)? Or do I have toExplodeinto SubShape Type - Edge? I've tried both and I get an error when trying to run Code_Aster.Thanks once again.Regards,JayJ",

What I didn't know was that I had to \"copy\" the groups to create them in the mesh too. I only created groups in the geometry...Now about the mesh, you used the NETGEN 1D-2D-3D algorithm. If I were to use another one like Hexadrons (which I think I can't use in the some parts of the supports because of its triangular form), is there any way to mesh different part of the sameCompoundwith different algorithms? Of course I'd like all the meshes to \"work togheter\", like there is only oneCompounddespite it is meshed separately.Is itCreate Sub-Meshwhat I am refering to? I am not sure it that's the use of that option.Regards,JayJ",
                "Hello, JayYes, this is exactly that. You need to use sub-meshes.You simply need to define the sub-parts of your geometry on which you want apply different meshing parameters, by creating groups or by simply exploding sub-geometries, then to create sub-mesh on your mesh associated to theses groups/sub-geometries.You can even (I did it sometimes) mesh your entire mesh using only sub-meshes.The groups you need to \"copy\" in the mesh are groups which you want to use in your solver.Groups used to create sub-meshes can be different and should not be copied in the mesh.Best regards,William",
                "Hello,I've just read another post of yours (here:http://salome-platform.org/forum/forum_11/453058143#566492653) where you say that in order to use the hexahedron algorithm I need acompound of volumes having  having exactly 6 faces, ¿16? edges and 8 vertexes.Of course the triangular prismatic support does not meet the requisites.The error message I get is\"Invalid input parameters. No Base vertex provided for a trilateral geometrical face\"Besides, using Hexahedrons the mesh created is like a shell (the prism is empty, there is a mesh in the external faces). So if I add Sub-Meshes later in the triangular faces, it creates an empty shell, not  a solid (actually I get an error when I compute the complete mesh with two sub-meshes: \"Error: unexpected geometry\", referring to the whole prism).** You replied before I finished writing this post. I've uploaden an image of the error, and theempty prismshowing the error message in the Mesh windows (the pink lines appear when I clikShow-Subshapeto know which part the error refers to). I create aFaceand thenExtrude along path, so it should be a solid, right? Is it empty because of the Hexahedron meshing error?Thank you very much for your time, and sorry to be so boring.Regards,JayJ",
                "HelloCreating structured mesh on prisms is a bit different.You need to create a sub-mesh on each of the triangles, to apply on each of them theQuadrangle (Mapping)2D algo and a differentQuadrangle Parametershypo in which your set the vertex touching the bar as theBase vertex(you need to select it in the 3D window and click onAdd).You also have to create a sub-mesh on both supports (you can create a group containing them) and apply on it the3D Extrusionalgo.Else, the automatic hexahedral parameters should do the trick.I enclose an HDF file soing this (I also split the bar into blocks).You can then easily modify the number of nodes in one edge executing on your geometry theOperations > Blocks > Propagatetool which creates groups of parallel edges. Then, you can create a sub-mesh on one of theses groups and apply on it theWire distretisationalgo and aNb. Segmentshypo.Best regards,WilliamPS: you don't bother me. I like to help",
                "Hello againFirst of all. Thank you very much for the last HDF file. It really helped me a lot on how to mesh the entire group of objetcs and I think it will do the work later for my \"experiment\" (I hope). Also, thanks for all the advices  you gave me throughout all your previous posts (theOperations > Blocks > Propagatetool for example, I didn't know about this one, and every time I created a mesh using Hexahedron algorithm in a rectangular objetc I was like \"Why not square blocks? ¬¬ \").I did all the geometry mysefl using your HDF and on my first try I get an error. But it was related with one of the \"blocks\" the bar was composed of. The mesh gave an error in both the end blocks (not in the middle one), where the Hexahedron algorithm was used. It said something about the face dividing \"blocks\"... I didn't take a screenshot, so I can't tell you exactly. But I created the mesh again and it worked.  =/Now I have another problem... The geometry is very similar to the last one, but now the two supports are perpendicular (the geometry is the same, triangular prisms). I follow the same procedure as in the other geometry, but when I want to create the mesh for the triangular faces of the supports, I can'tAddtheBase Vertex. I can't select it in the 3D view.I usedExplodeto create aVertex(as you did in your HDF, I think) in theFace. Did not work. I also tried exploding into vertexes afterExtrusionand afterFusingboth supports, didn't work either. So...I'm stuck there.About the support, is it correct toFusethem? I have also tried creating aPartitionwith both, but it creates like four \"supports\". UsingMeasures > Basic PropertiesI think the correct one isFuse, since both the surface and lenght inPartitonare bigger (that is,Partitionconsiders the surface of both supports in the center where they meet).Best regards,Jay",
                "Hello,Another question. Since the the bar is \"divided in three blocks\", do you know if it works as a continuum? I mean, if what I am trying to simulate is, for example, an homogeneus continuum steel profile, will it work like that? Or having those \"blocks\" will cause the complete bar to work as a \"glued compound\"?I need the bar to \"behave\" like that in order to use the solver later (Code_Aster). If I useClippingit does look like an unique solid...Regards,Jay",
                "Hello Jay,You should be able to select base vertexes without problem (I have done this for years through several Salome version without any problem). But actualy if you use a Windows version, there is maybe a bug in it (I can't compare since I don't have Windows...).Just to be very clear : you don't need to explode any vertexes at all. Just to select the vertex in the Mesh window (the VTK window) when editing the quadrangle hypothesis...About your new geometry... there is a problemFirst of all, the fuse operation for supports is not suitable here, because in order to create a blocking you cannot fuse blocks but you have to put them side by side in the final compound.So, the partition option is the good one.Now, the problem is that the partition creates a \"block\" being a pyramid at the intersection between the supports. I don't see any meshing algorithm in Salome able to mesh a structured pyramid. It is maybe possible to split the blocking but it will be a hard work. I propose to mesh it with tetras (eg. using theTetrahedron (Netgen)algo + aNETGEN 3D Parametershypo).About triangle faces, also internal faces have to be meshed with a base vertex. For faces sharing a same base vertex (like at the intersection of supports), you can create a single sub-mesh using a face group.And to answer to your last question, the way to define what is the bar and what is the support for Code Aster is to create a volume group containing all blocks describing the bar and another volume group for the support, then \"copy\" them in the mesh using theCreate Groups from Geometrytool as explained before. Groups which are not \"copied\" like this in the mesh are not viewed by Code Aster, and all elements being in each of these groups are considered to be one single continuum.I attach an HDF file.Best regards,William",
                "Hello William,Thanks for everything once again.I could not select vertexes to create the mesh because I was doing it wrong. It looks like the face where the vertex is must be hidden in the VTK window (with hidden I mean the eye-icon not selected). At least that's what happened to me after being like 2 minutes cliking the vertexes without results... I was using the Windows OS version too, but it happened again when using the Ubuntu OS version. If that's not  really neccesary to be able to select the vertexes, I don't know. But it worked.I said that aboutExplodevertexes because I saw aVertex \"group\" within theFaceobjetcin theObjetc Browser, and I thought I had to do that.On the other hand, I have been working with the last HDF file you attached and yes, it is a bit difficult to mesh the cross support withHexahedronalgorithm, so I decided to useTetrahedronsinstead as you stated. And that's what I've been testing this weekend.And, of course, I have two new question with theTetrahedronalgorithm.In my case, the mesh for the supports does not have to be very fine. But the mesh for the bar have to. So, If I use this algorithm for the whole geometry (both bar and support), is it better to create a coarse mesh and then a finer mesh for the bar, or to create a fine mesh and then make it coarser for the support? Maybe it really doesn't matter?In the first case (coarse_fine.hdfin the attachment), I had to add a1D algorithm (Wire Discretisation)to the upper edges of the support (those in contact with the bar), since otherwise the bottom face of the bar had bigger tetrahedrons than what I wanted (it was like a transition from the big tetrahedrons of the support to the smaller ones of the bar I guess).In the second case (fine_coarse.hdfin the attachment), the same thing but with the lower edges of the support(and also to those of the triangular faces).What I realised is that if there is a big difference in the hypothesis (and therefore in the size/volume of the tetrahedrons)I got an error.The circular sub-mesh in the upper face of the bar is to simulate an impact surface (I didn't get an error message when creating this sub-mesh, so I guess it works). I did have an error message if the surrounding mesh wasn't fine enough though.And the second question. The new bar is a cylinder (cylinder.hdfin the attachment), and the support has a circular form. The mesh \"tries to do something strange\". That is, I don't know how to do it. I created a mesh for the cylinder, without support, but using the same algorithms and hypothesis (Tetrahedron (Netgen) + Quadrangle (Mapping)for the body, andRadian Quadranglefor both end faces).Thank you in advance.Regards,JayPS: Sorry for the looong post.",
                "Hello,A few things I forgot in my last post.I think I can answer to my first question. I think it is not necessary to create a sub-mesh in the support nor the bar. If I add a1D algorithm (Wire Discretisation)to the lower edges of the support, it will do the work. Is that true? That is, it is enough to create a fine mesh to the whole geometry (Partition) and then add the 1D algorithm.Related to my question about the bar working as a continuum, I think it does. I have done a few test with Code_Aster and it looks like that. For example, if a force is applied in the upper face of the middle \"block\" of the bar, this \"block\" goes down and both the end \"blocks\" go up.And the last thing for now, is it possible to add a \"circular\" surface in the cylinder (similar to theDiskin the bar)? It would be a small spherical surface (not plane), but still bigger than just a point.Thank you in advance.Regards,Jay",
                "Hello Jay,Sorry for the late response.Very quickly:If you want tetras in the whole mesh, this is pretty much easier than hexas.The best is to use the Netgen 1D-2D-3D algo.Put the coarser parameters in your mesh, and create a sub-mesh associated with the bar with finer parameters. Because sub-meshes have always priority on global parameters.About the cylindrical bar, it seems to me strange to use quadrangles with tetras. Previously I proposed to use tetras only in the pyramidal block due to crossing supports, and hexas everywhere else. But if you want tetras everywhere, so triangles are better.So, what you can do is use also the Netgen 1D-2D-3D algo everywhere.Now, if you want hexas, it is more complicated. I propose to begin with a divided cylinder (New Entity > Blocks > Divided Cylinder), then so split it so as to create a blocking.I enclose an HDF file doing so.Else, creating a small cylindrical face on the bar like you did is OK for tetras.And yes, continuums are defined by volume groups in the mesh, not by the volume distribution in the Geometry module.Best regards,William"

The coders ofthis method , some time ago,  have limited this case thinking thiscase not helpfully due to memory consumption that these three levelssimultaneously implies (in your example 8 cells -> 36 faces -> 54 edges and foreach nodal and desc conn). For big meshes this could be huge.2D->1D descending connectivity computation is for mesh with meshdim==2.Lake of chance for you, edges inside your 3D simple mesh are shared by up to 4 faces that's why you have exception.That's why I give you the tinycomputeLinearEdgeDescConnectivity function in the attached fileto perform the job.One more thing concerning MED file in your convertor MyFormat->MEDFile if you intend to use MESHING class I recommend you to set nodal rather than descending connectivity.Finally, yes I'm working on Salomé and I've been part of developpement team of ParaMEDMEM, INTERP_KERNEL in MED and YACS and  sometimes I try to help people using MEDMEM..."

Then sphereSurfaces are defined as all faces extracted by inlet, outlet and wall. So within the geometry moduleall faces are defined. Check shape: valid. Check compound of blocks:extra edges. Repair - remove extra edges does not work and says can't build object. Glue faces says that there are no faces to glue.Problem:Meshing withNetgen 1D-2D-3Dgives no errors, but when exporting to OpenFOAM sphereSurfaces and fixedWall are considered asfaceZoneand boundary faces belong to different mesh cells. This aborts ideasUnvToFoam, but passing by gmsh makes it possible to import withextra default faces.Solution trials:Geo: Partitioning (slower operation) instead of cutting gives also extra edges. Cutting of spheres gives quite quickly extra edges. Remove extra edges fails.Mesh: Salome: Merge elements succeeds, but doesn't change problem. Meshing of tube with 200/2877 spheres cutted works and gives no default faces even though there are extra edges. Gmsh meshing says for 2D meshing: \"impossible to recover edges\" depending on options 30 - 150 of these errors.Following link gives you a .brep, .hdf and some screenshots:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3zlnh60q6drj8bc/AAAuy5sTaqOsq32F-P3MyRXha?dl=0Thanks!Kind regards,Adriaan",

                "I have two problems when meshing the attached (in the next post) sphere in 6.6 or 6.5 (I haven't tried other versions.)The first problem is that when partitioning the sphere I receive two edges on the top line instead of 1 ( error 'Face must have 4 sides but not 6') If I partition the sphere in half along the midline I get a very odd shaped pattern of quads. See the attached image.My questions are1) is there a way to tell the 2d algorithim that these 2 edges should be treated as 1?2) Why is the mesh so oddly shaped when partitioned?",
                "See attached script",
                "Hello,About the first problem:You have this problem because the sphere is actually a surface of revolution created from a half-circle. You can see this arc by exploding your sphere into edges (New Entity -> Explode, then choose \"Edge\" asSub-shapes type).Doing this, you will see three new edges in the study tree inside theSphere_1object. The first two are the result of the revolution of the boundary vertexes of the revolution edge (and so are \"void\"). The last one is the revolution edge itself.When you cut your sphere, you did it so as to cross this revolution edge. And this led to additional edges in your final object. You can see it by exploding it into edges. You can see that one edge is split in its middle.Two solutions:- Cut your sphere in another position to avoid the revolution edge.- Rebuild the faces which are impacted by this revolution edge after the cut.Enclosed is a dump study in which I rebuilt the two faces impacted by the revolution edge (solution 2).About the second problem:It is possible that sometimes the way of construction of the shapes in the Geometry module impact the way they are meshed in the mesh module (especially for bent or twisted surfaces).One time again, the best way to fix it is to rebuild the faces in a very proper way, so as to \"orient\" them like in the mesh. For example, by trying to have their iso-curves (the curves that are visible inside the faces when displayed in Wireframe mode) the more parallel possible to the desired mesh.This problem is also solved in the previous dump study since I rebuilt the revolution surface of your geometry in this way.Best regards,William",

            "discussion": [
                "Hi everybody,I'm new to salome (i've been using it for less than a month), and I'm interested in hexahedral meshes for CFD simulations.I'm trying to create a C-grid around a NACA airfoil for a 2D viscous CFD simulation in OpenFOAM. Using Python scripts, I have managed to create a face around the airfoil and to mesh it with a 2D quadrangle algorithm, using propagation of 1D hypotheses from the airfoil contour to the external boundary. Once this grid is properly refined, I will extrude it of one cell.However, in my mesh the cells are very inclined near the wall. I'd like to ask whether there is a way to impose grid orthogonality to the face edges, as it happens when dealing with C-grid structured meshes.I'll attach some images to make what i mean more clear.Thank you in advance,Luca",
                "The first image refers to the grid i wish to create. The following one is a zoom of my current mesh.Thanks.",
                "Hi LucaI propose splitting the face around the airfoil into several logic quadrangles by lines normal to airfoil boundary (see the attached picture). Sptitting can be done using Partition.St.Michael",
                "Thank you, St.Michael.I will try your hint. However, in this way, I can only satisfy the orthogonality approximately: the higher the number of partitions, the better approximation I will get. I was wondering if there is any means to put this requirement into the mesh hypotheses, but if there is not, I'll try to make your method suite my needs.Luca",
                "Unfortunately it's impossible to set orthogonality constraint to meshing parameters.Maybe the mesh would become closer to your need if you created the face around airfoil from a scaled airfoil profile?St.Michael",

                "Hello Luca,Viscous layer meshing is not easy with Salome. But I developed a user friendly Python library to do so in few steps only (and even more). It will be soon available from theVZLUwebsite. I am finishing the documentation.I let you know went it will be available.Concerning your issue, you can create edges perpendicular to your airfoil by this way:First, extrude your airfoil in its plane normal direction (eg. in the Z direction if your airfoil lies on the XY plane).Then, create a vertex on your airfoil where you want the edge to start.Then create a normal to the extruded surface at your vertex position. You will get a vector normal to your airfoil. You can then construct your perpendicular edge by extruding your vertex or copy it and create an edge from two vertexes.Concerning the external viscous layer shape, I mean the \"offset\" of the airfoil, you can close your extruded face to make a solid. Then, you can use the offset tool of Salome (which applies only on solids) to create an offset around the whole solid. But then you can just cut this offset face with a plane and you will get your airfoil offset.Sometimes, this offset method doesn't work properly. So you can create a Python routine which will create one hundred normal vectors around the airfoil with the method I gave above and construct one hundred offset vertexes, then link them with a spline. This is what my library does, among other possibilities.Please, be patient.William",
                "Hello,The script I told about is now available. You can generate easily C grids around foils (or other things) thanks to it. I present this script here :http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_12/238346311It is optimized for hybrid meshing but I don't see any reason not to use it for fully structured grids.Best regards,William",

I can of course rotate the vector by 180° but I'm just wondering whether there's a faster way to achieve this.Thanks,Dirk",

                "Hi,I do support JMB comment.For user, accessing a bug tracker (and possibly reporting to it) doesn't not necessarily mean expecting that the bug will be fixed in a near future. It is also a way to know if for some user's manipulations, it is the \"user fault\" or a bug of the system, as noticed by other users. It can prevent users to spend hours in unsuccessful tries.It would also give some more global vision of the status of Salome, and possibly motivate external companies to pay for fixes. Indeed with a global vision, one knows if one pays to fix one bug bug, if there will there be others related or if it will solve 'definitely' an identified problem.Finally for developpers, it means a wider feedback for free that can be of good quality (usually, users that will go up to report a bug are quite motivated users and will do it quite well with some material to reproduce the bug). It thus means a better global vision of the current status of Salome so as to orient the development efforts and define the roadmap (ie priorities) (is a functionality completely unusuable or not?). Definitely, it should have some value (why Ktiware would have started its \"adopt a bug\" system otherwise?).I guess all these items have already come to the development team mind.It would thus just be nice for the community to know at least the reasons preventing this access of the bugtracker to the external community (and at least, it would prevent further threads on this very same topic).Bests,Pierre"

                "Hello everybody,I couldn't find an example from internet nor forum how to operate with complicated real life structures like mine: a combination of hollow squared pipe profile in which there are reinforced holes and castings on the ends. CAD model in imported from SolidWorks as a single STEP which I exploded to parts in geometry. Focus is in structural analysis (not CFD), and as this is only a member of larger assembly, the mesh should be very economical.What I would like to do, is to:-Mesh the flat thin surfaces of the squared pipe with a single layer of relatively large regular hexahedrons,-Mesh the bended corners with 4 to 6 hexahedrons (15 to 22.5 deg per element, same length than the flat surfaces have),-Mesh the hole reinforcement rings with circular hexahedrons,-And finally let the Netgen 1-2-3D take care of the massive castings.All meshes should be continuous (degenerated hexas to join the regular hexahedrons to tetrahedrons).I coulnd't find a way to get this done. Supposedly I should somehow separate (is partitioning the correct function for this?) the regular areas fom the model and mesh them separately but all attempts created crashes. Also even relatively simple geometries created quadrangle 2D and tetrahedron 3D meshes atop each others. No good. The flat areas could also be meshed with 3D wedges if hexahedrons don't work. Could that be done by creating a mesh to one surface of flat areas and extruding that through the wall thickness? How can the connection to adjacent meshes then be arranged?Sorry to bother you with such a simple problem but experience from other meshers make me assume that this functionality is included in Salome, it seems to be very capable for many things.Best regards,Timo",
                "Hello,I would propose to share here the geometry or a simplified one.Yes, the right process is to make aCompoundincluding the whole geometry to be meshed (and the simplest way is indeed to use thePartitiontool), then to distinguish sub-geometries on which applying different meshing algorithms (this can be done using theExplodeor theCreate Grouptool).Maybe you have errors during meshing because the geometry needs to be repaired or prepared to be compatible with the algorithms you want to use.Best regards,William",
                "Hello William,many thanks for your quick response. I will simplify the geometry to a level still including all typical problems.Yes, there are obviously something wrong with my meshing attempts, list of errors is loooong. However something nasty tends to happen if I try to use \"Show sub-Shape\" button with one of tem: the entire program stops responding. And also I noticed that hexotic gives always an error from chmod command (which doesn't exist in Windows). Should I install also some additional linux-services? My computer is Win7-64.Best regards,Timo",
                "Hello Timo,I cannot support you about the Windows version.Also, as Hexotics necessitates a commercial license, I cannot support about this neither.In case of persisting troubleshooting with the Window version, there is always the solution to use a virtual machine.Best regards,William",

The values are changed but have no effect to the sketch.Also I would like to change the length of a Extrusion but can't find a way. Can it be done at all or it the only method to delete the Extrusion and redo the whole thing again?Many thanks for your guidance,Timo",
                "Hello Timo,I didn't mean I cannot support you at allI think what you want can be done without Hexotic.

                "Hi William,please find enclosed my structure (radically simplified). Large bended sheet metal areas with local castings and reinforcements.I tried to split this already in SolidWorks to separate bodies because parametric sketching makes life so much easier (flat plate areas, plate corners as own individual bodies etc.) but that didn't work as Salome couldn't figure out continuity between parts. The result was independent meshes instead of common nodes to the common edges and faces. Is the only sensible method to use partitioning in Salome or can I somehow use the separate parts via fusing and repartitioning?Best regards,Timo",
                "Hello Timo,Quick response to the question above:If parts are sharing identical faces, so you should be able to reconnect them usingRepair > Glue Faces. (This necessitates to have them all in one single compound).By the way, very nice geometryI will have a look at it as soon as I have timeBest regards,William",
                "Hello,I think this is the best you can expect from Salome on this kind of geometry:The first step was to look for parts of the geometry which could be meshed with blocks. I found the reinforcement and the upper part of the thin sheet and rebuilt them with blocks:For the rest of the thin sheet, it looked more complicated to use blocks, so I propose to mesh them with prisms. This said, theNetgen 1D-2Dalgo is also able to generate quadrangles (by checkingAllow Quadranglesin the hypothesis setup window), and it finally looks like structured mesh when the meshed face is bounded by perpendicular edges. So I split this part  so as to isolate the reinforcement:This also necessitated to remove a chamfer inside the geometry to ensure a same topology between opposite faces of the sheet:I put the rest of the geometry in a single solid so as to mesh it with tetras:Resulting mesh, with coarse parameters:Possible improvements:- mesh the cylinders with structured mesh- mesh some parts of the thicker sheet at the bottom with prisms as well- with a finer mesh, it would be possible to create quadrangles even in the part linking the reinforcement and the structured sheet.Here is the HDF file:http://www.petit-fichier.fr/2015/01/01/real-life-case-hdf/real-life-case-hdf.7zLots of intermediate shapes were unpublished. To see them, right-click onGeometryin the study tree and selectPublish....Hope you will find this usefullBest regards,William",
                "Hello again William,Sorry to bother you continuously with my problems. However I think some other rookie users might find this conversation helpfull with their first steps with Salome. Would it be acceptable if I collect my experiences to a booklet?First I tried splitting the top of geometry to a separate body in SolidWorks. Then the splitting is totally parametric so this has to be done there untill new geometry module is available. Are there methods available to update the Step geometry with a new one having additional splittings without loosing all definitions done before? It would be a miracle gift!Then I imported the geometry as a Step, exploded it to get the separate bodies visible and glued it together. Also picked the 8 curved edges from top body to an own group to be able to give them correct splitting (nb=4).The top body meshed perfectly, just as I want it. However I get always this error message when meshing the top body:\"Hexa_3 / Split1[2](1:1:1:5:3) / Error in locate children():1058.\"Meshing the main body next gives this error message:\"NETGEN_2D3D / Split1[1](0:1:1:5:4) / NgException at Volume meshing: Stop meshing since boundary mesh is overlapping.\"Extremely comprehensive! Can you give any advice what is missing or is there somewhere a list of error messages and their explanations with possible causes?I allowed Netgen 1D2D3D to try also quadrangle elements in Mesh_2 (the main body) but the results is confusing: if I interpreted it correctly, there is a quadrangle surface mesh and a tetragonal  solid mesh operlapping. Strange.If I don't allow quadrangles, the main body meshing goes OK, but still gluing fails, the meshes don't have same splitting on edges. Should the edges also be glued?I tried to add the model hdf-file but it exceeds 100kB with even the tightest compression, so there are only this picture and splitted model Step files enclosed.Then another question: some meshing programs can hangle 5-corner surface and solid blocks this way. It is extremely usefull with structures having holes in them. All you need it splitting them from geometry. The five sub areas can be meshed automatically. Internal edges meet the midpoints of outer edges. Only adjustable item is the mid point location, default seldom works if the 5-corner geometry is much distorted.Best regards and have a succesfull year 2015!Timo",
                "Dear William,still continuing. I opened your example but couldn't quite understand the reasoning of operations you have done with it.A big picture in Geometry seems to be that you exploded the entire geometry to atoms and recreated lots of different goups of faces and edges and vertices.Then you formed sort of recollected new goups (reinforcement_blocking and thin_parts) from them by glueing some of them togerther. Are the results solids or still something else?Where did the missing surfaces (bottom surface slices of \"thin_parts\" and \"reinforcement_blocking\" through side walls) appear from?Then a new goups \"surface_fix\" (shell) but for what purpose?Then you form a solid \"unstructured_part\" for tetrahedron meshing later on. Understod this. Wow!Then \"final_object\": lots of new groups and stuff glued together again. For what purpose?***In meshing you have used the \"final_object\" as parent solid and all other meshes are submeshes to it. Is this correct interpretation?\"pure_blocks\" and \"prisms\" are understandable but what is the reason for all the other submeshes?Huh, lots of fuzzy things.***So, with much more complicated parts consisting of multiple bodies cut separate in SolidWorks, do I really need to explode everything? Enormous job! Is there a more straight forward approach when I can easily manipulate the body splitting in SW?Best regards,Timo",
                "Hi William,still trying to find a way. It seems Salome treats totally different way coinciding geometry than previous programs I have used. I can't get it to understand that certain edges and faces are common between solid bodies although they run exactly the same route and end point coordinates are exactly same within double precision. I couldn't either find this from any part of the manuals. Is there somewhere a clear description of the program ideology inside and how the geometry operations should be arranged to get topological continuity? Plain guessing doesn't lead any further, there are so many options that hitting the right answer seems to be a lottery win.Best reagrds,Timo",
                "Hello Timo,Lots of questions, so I won't detail a lot each point, but give quick responses.Would it be acceptable if I collect my experiences to a booklet?I don't exactly understand what you mean by \"booklet\", but I think you are free to do whatever you wantAre there methods available to update the Step geometry.Short answer: Not possible...Long answer: maybe by making a study dump ([Ctrl]+[D]), then modify the path to the STEP file in the script and launch it in a new study ([Ctrl]+[T]).Unfortunately, python dumping does not work properly sometimes (depending on the Salome version).Then I glued separate bodies togetherYou could glue directly the imported STEP itself, actually. (Select the STEP, thenRepair > Glue Faces, thenApply and Close).But the glue operation has effect only on the resulting shape (Glue_1) and its children.The top body meshed perfectlyUnfortunately, I think it didn't... I tried to mesh this solid like you, had the same error, and could see no volumes were generated (only the surface mesh).To make the Hexahedron algo work, it is (almost always) necessary to have a pure blocking, that is a geometry split into solids having exactly 6 faces, 12 edges and 8 vertexes. This is what I did and what you can see in thepure_blocksgroup of the final object.\"NETGEN_2D3D / Split1[1](0:1:1:5:4) / NgException at Volume meshing: Stop meshing since boundary mesh is overlapping.\"This means there is a problem in the surface mesh, like intersecting or redundant elements. Sometimes you have aShow Bad Meshbutton with the error, to see were is the problem. But when preparing the geometry correctly (what we're gonna do), this should not happenthere is a quadrangle surface mesh and a tetragonal  solid mesh operlapping. Strange.Strange! But trueShould the edges also be glued?Actually no: what you need is put everything in a single mesh associated to the glued object (Glue_1), then apply sub-meshes on different exploded shapes or groups.Then another question: some meshing programs can hangle 5-corner surface and solid blocks this wayNever heard of that in Salome... (Maybe in a future version)couldn't quite understand the reasoning of operations you have doneActually, I rebuilt lots of things to prepare a geometry 100% compatible with meshing algos to be used.So I first extracted some sub-shapes form the STEP file, then made lots of little steps to do \"simple\" things (like rebuild the blocking for the reinforcement).Also, I did not delete anything in the study, so you can see some few unnecessary steps.I let published some intermediate shapes to show you roughly what I did, but the only important shape  is the last one (final_object).Then you formed sort of recollected new goups (reinforcement_blocking and thin_parts) from them by glueing some of them togerther. Are the results solids or still something else?This shapes are compounds of solids, indeed.Where did the missing surfaces (bottom surface slices of \"thin_parts\" and \"reinforcement_blocking\" through side walls) appear from?Actually I rebuilt these shapes in Salome, using  extrusions/revolutions to recreate solids.Then a new goups \"surface_fix\" (shell) but for what purpose?I just removed a chamfer in the geometry which prevented from having a same topology between opposite faces of the thin sheet solids (this was necessary because of theExtrusion 3Dalgo).Before:After:In meshing you have used the \"final_object\" as parent solid and all \nother meshes are submeshes to it. Is this correct interpretation?As parentcompound(of solids). This is the main object in which everything is contained.what is the reason for all the other submeshes?corners + *_edges= 1D sub-meshes to control the number of segments in the blocking parts.prisms_thickness= 1D sub-mesh to control the number of layers in the prism part.source_*= 2D sub-meshes for the prism parts. TheExtrusion 3Dalgo copies these meshes to the opposite face of each solid.Is there a more straight forward approach when I can easily manipulate the body splitting in SWI prepared the geometry in Salome, but there is absolutely no reason why not do the same in Solidworks, with the only one limitation: the creation of groups on the final object must be done in Salome.(When I speak of \"groups\", I meanNew Entity > Group > Create Group, not \"compounds\")This said, you can prepare groups in Solidworks as separated objects, import them in Salome and use them in theCreate Groupwindow as filters for the group creation by checking theGeometrical parts of the Second Shapeor theOnly Sub-shapes of the Second Shapeoption (thenSelect All).It seems Salome treats totally different way coinciding geometry than previous programs I have used.Salome is different from other softwares about many aspectsIs there somewhere a clear description of the program ideology inside \nand how the geometry operations should be arranged to get topological \ncontinuity?As said before: you have to put everything in one single compound and create a single mesh on it, and then use sub-meshes to apply different algos on sub-shapes or groups.OK, I hope now things are clearerBest regards,William",

Yet, I think there is a problem in volume calculation for polyhedron, as an isotropic space scale transform should modify the volume by the scale power 3. To prove that, we can decompose the polyhedron into tetrahedron, and sum the the volume of each tetrahedron which is:V = 1/6 det( AB, AC, AD) = 1/6 det ( B-A, C-A, D-A )For a \"x\" factor scale we get:V' = 1/6 det ( x (B-A), x (C-A), x (D-A) ) = x^3/6 det( AB, AC, AD) = x^3*VAfter the sum on each tetrahedron, we always have the x^3 factor.Am i right ?Thanks for the support,Moise",

                "Hi, good that there is a way to control the growth rate in the new mesh algorithm Netgen 1D-2D-3D (in salome 5.1.5).Without this kind of control(thus with all other mesh alghoritms within salome) I think there is no efficient way to create a reasonable mesh if you have a model where you want steep transition from coarse to fine mesh. For example if you have small fillets in your model. Using partitioning in the geometry module is too much work, it is not a efficient way of working.However I have some trouble to get along with the Netgen 1D-2D-3D method in salome.I have some small edges in my model. These edges are necessary for my evaluation. To my knowledge There is no way to make the 1D-2D-3D alghorithm disregard these edges. The results is high mesh density at these edges which means  great loss of computation speed. Is there a way to prevent this? (Is there a way to make salome disregard the geometry edge size of parts of the geometry?). See also attached picture(the is a narrow face along the fillet ).I have tried using the local size option within the Netgen 1D-2D-3D alghorithm but it seems this local size is only an upper bound for the size. Is it? (I can not find information on this in the documentation)I have tried using submeshes together with Netgen 1D-2D-3D. The reults is unexpected: salome then disregards the size of these edges in the Netgen 1D-2D-3D alghorithm(good!) however the resulting mesh is linear. Strange behaviour! -is it a bug? I then tried to solve this problem using the conversion from linear to quadratic mesh (midside nodes on geometry option). However some midside nodes get projected false. But I guess projecting the midside nodes onto the geometry is not an easy task.Also i think it is a big disadvantage to define growth rate for the whole volume. For example why not define growth rate (3D) in the definition of a submesh (2D)?  By doing this the growth rate could be controlled locally (and small edges somewhere else would cause no problem).If you have some usefull tips and tricks, please post them!Best Regards,Micke",
                "Hi, \n\nat least in the original NETGEN there is a switch \"Meshing Options > Insider > Use Local Meshsize\". \nThis is by default switched on causing NETGEN to produce locally refined meshes at sharp edges. Turning it off does the job you want; however, I did not find this switch in the SALOME interface to NETGEN. It might however be a very good idea to make this option accessible to SALOME users! \n\nBest regards, B.",
                "Ok, Thank you for the information. So perhaps the functionallity in netgen is there but without control through salome gui then. I looked in the documentation to see if more options where available through the tui but I have found nothing.I also read somewere that local size on face is possible in the windows version of salome. It will not fix the problem in this case but that would be a good function.If you have more tips on how to solve this issue, please post it.

                "hello,i've recently been using salome for preparing a mesh for a CFD-Analysis and i'm facing some problems with the meshing part. i've been doing every tutorial i could possibly find but somehow i'm still not getting the meshing part. i have not really a complex geometry (see pic in attachment) but i still can't manage to get a working mesh. i've read something about submeshes and partition and so but i haven't found an example that explains how to use it. my goal is to just get a 3D volumetric mesh. it would be great if it consisted out of hexagonal-elements but i'm pretty sure that's not gonna work out with this geometry. so which would be the main actions if i wanted to generate a mesh from this geometry. and i just have to geometry imported as an iges-file. i'd be really thankfull for some easy instructions or links to good examples or documentations...",

To do that, you have to explode your shape to find the two bottom cylinder faces and in the netgen 1D2D3D hypothesis, there is a \"local sizes\" tab in which you can define local sizes for those two faces. This local size will be propagate in the volume.May be you can try this feature and if it fits your needs, I can try to explain how to compile the netgen plugin with this feature.Regards, E.A.",

                "Hello.I'm not sure if this is what you ask but, yes, you can mesh with specific nodes. In order to do that, you need to create a mesh on a 'Partition' containing both your 'box' and the nodes (points) with the (x,y,z) coordinates you want.- So, first create your box.- Then, create as many points as you need.- Select [i]Operations - Partition[/i]. In the new window, for 'Objects' select the box and all the nodes (in the Object Browser or the 3D view). Apply & Close.- A new object will be created (Partition_1 by default). Right-click - 'Create group' in this object, node (the first one) for Shape Type, and select the nodes (one group per node, or all points in the same group, depending on your needs). Apply & Close.*If the nodes are inside the box (not in the surface), select the new object (Partition_1) in the object browser and 'New Entity' -> 'Explode', with 'Vertex' as 'Sub-shapes type'. Apply & Close.After that, you can mesh your geometry. If the mesh is fine/small enough, there will be nodes in your points. Once your mesh is computed, right click on it, 'Create Group from Geometry', and select the nodes in the object browser (those you just created with 'Create Group').I've attached an HDF file with two examples. You have to compute the first mesh. The second is already computed and clipped so you can see the point previously defined is a node of the mesh.Hope it helps. Maybe someone else comes with an easier way to do this.Regards,J.C.",

If you want a fine mesh and your points are separated, say, 2 m, there will be a lot more points in the mesh than those few you need. Maybe a coarser mesh will fit your conditions.But, sincerely, I do not now if it is possible to create a mesh which has nodes only in specific given points. Maybe someone else knows how to do that and he may answer you.Anyway, can you please encolse a file with your geometry?  Just in case I  manage to do what you want.Regards,J.C.",

This one will generate the mesh.What to do:- Put all your nodes in aNew Entity > Compound.- Export this compound intoIGESformat.- Put your exported IGES file beside the enclosed octave script.- Edit the octave script to adapt the name of the IGES file.- Open a terminal, go to the folder and type:octave generateDelaunayMeshScript.mThis should generate ascript.pyfile to launch in Salome (7.x) and generating the mesh.The next step is to create mesh groups. They will have to be created manually since there is no geometry association. But if you have only 50 nodes, this should not be time-consuming.That's it!Hope it is suitable for you.Best regards,William",

                "Hi,I created a spherical shell mesh (1/8 of a sphere actually)  that I took great care to partition correctly in order to ease meshing.(I am far from being skilled: there might be far easier approach to get the partition, but at least, it has been done)I then meshed this 8th of a sphere.You will find enclosed the python script that I cleaned.What I find unsatisfying in the result mesh is the top third of the mesh, and most particularly the top element that is larger than the other elements when one might expect equivalent size with the 2 other extreme elements (with respect to X and Z axis).This expectation might seem somewhat strict, but then, let's turn the mesh to quadratic with mid nodes on geometry: this element simply turns ugly.I don't think that this behaviour is acceptable, and wanted to report it. However, I don't have any idea where might be the mistake.I mean, the way it is partitioned, SMESH shouldn't behave like this, should it?I thank you for your comment to improve this simple mesh, because I actually would like to use it.Have a good evening.Bests,PierrePS: using Salome 6.5.0",

                "Hi PierreThis case is very specific because actually the face, mesh on which you complain about, has 5 edges and not 4. The 5-th edge is a degenerated edge at sphere's apex. In parametric 2D space this face looks like a pentagon. It required many tricks (including smoothing) to make such faces meshed with quadrangles of this quality if ever.To avoid this I advise you to cut off a part of the sphere that does not include the apex (see your modified script).Best regardsEdward",
                "Hi Edward,Thank you very much for your help.I understand your explanation.I understand that such a degenerated edge might be needed to represent the shape in GEOM and therefore understand that it cannot be solved with the healing procedure that should return a geometrical shape.On the other hand, I am surprised that this could not be solved by a pre-treatment procedure in SMESH checking for degenerated edge, and merging of nearly coincident nodes just before meshing. Such a procedure could be turned on by a boolean just before meshing.Is it not a viable solution, far less complex than post treatment of mesh with smoothing procedure?Bests,Pierre",
                "Dear PierreThe mapping algorithm used by \"Quadrangle (mapping)\" mesher works in 2D space and 2D result is then mapped into 3D. Thus the issue is that the face is 5-sided in 2D. The attached picture shows it's 2D representation. The upper horizontal edge there is one at sphere apex.So a current solution includes not only smoothing.Best regardsEdward",

            "discussion": [
                "Hello @al,I am presently trying to investigate the heat transfer mechanisms in structured walls, e.g. like a brick wall. To do so, I took Salomé's multi-translation function to define a larger number of bricks, separated by respective spacings to be interpreted as mortar/grout. The resulting mesh was so far sensible after applying the partition option to the bricks and the remaining mortar body.But now the problems come: I'd like to take Elmer as the heat spread calculation tool. Saving the mesh in UNV format let me load the Salomé created mesh in Elmer. But prior to starting the simulation I'd have to define the volume und boundary conditions, namely the heat capacities and heat conductances of the respective bodies, and the heat transfer coefficients at all interfaces of bricks and mortar. For a sensibly resolved brick wall that procedure creates several ten bricks and some hundred interfaces.Elmer supports a wonderful visual allocation of boundary conditions to respective volumes/surfaces, but with such numbers of objects the methodology is simply a pain. Here a programmatic creation of the Elmer SIF control file would be much more appropriate. But to do so, I'd need the numbering of faces and bodies, which would have to come directly from the mesh definition.I do not see how to obtain them, though. Could someone point me in a sensible direction?Kind regards,Peter",

The other faces of the volume have to be meshed withquadranglesonly. It seems that the two surface meshes on the front and the back of your volume are different, because theQuandranglealgo doesn't handle the transition between your fine and coarse mesh similarly (you can check it by displaying the mesh in wireframe mode and by looking in the OZ direction - in parallel mode).What you can do to ensure the surface mesh will be the same on the front and the back sides of your mesh is to project one on the other, using the algoProjection 2D. To do so you need to create a geometrical group containing the source face and another for the target face. Then you can create a sub-mesh on the target face putting the source face in the hypothesis.Hope this will helpBest regardsWilliam",

                "Hi St Michael,When I export the meshes I require them to have different names, so the transition process is an option, however I would ideally like the transition to rename the faces if this is possible? It would be really useful to gain a full guide on the Smesh builder (even just trying to follow other peoples codes has been a struggle for me). I have found the Salome instructions very comprehensive and diverse for geometry and well written but I have struggled a fair bit with the meshing using a python script.I use the compound option once meshed to export the whole file. In this case I require all of the meshes to belong to the same Volume so they do not get split up when performing CFD. When I tried this the compound option has the volumes as separate so this would be seen as two different volumes which would not solve the issue. I could try to use the stichmesh option in my solver which binds meshes together however I would hope to do this in Salome to have less errorsI require the cylinder mesh to be used in legs of the chair, however the body of the chair is required to be meshed using a standard tetrahedral meshing algorithm. The reason for this is when using the nugen method of meshing the legs of the chair the mesh volume was 3/4 the volume of the geom volume (admittedly a low mesh quality to reduce elements). When testing this with the cylinder example the mesh has 98%+ volume ratio which is very important and this method required even less elements although the centre square in the method produces an additional volume which isn't ideal but has some added benefits. Ideally I would like the outside face to be one face although the geom module didn't like selecting the outsides as a single face due to the planes being placed through it.I have attached a picture of the connecting part when the chair and the legs are used as a single volume, however the mesh quality of the legs is not good enough for the solver. As you might have guessed it isn't a chair it is a nuclear reactor, but I wanted to keep the analogy simple. I have created the cylinder meshes for the fuel elements, this part is the coolant area which is represented as a single volume with an input and output.Cheers,",

Why \"not second order\"? IMHO \"quadratic\" means \"second order\".If you convert a linear mesh into a quadratic one (== second order), the mesh volume must increase (if a cylinder is meshed) by definition. Because elements follow the shape more closer.   Number of cells remains the same, only additional nodes appear.How did you measure the volume?Is it not possible to combine meshes in such a way?It's possible but let's try a simpler solution first.St.Michael",

This I assume calculates the overall volume of the cells. This was the same volume used in the neutronics package I imported the mesh into.Cheers,Seddon",

                "Hi St Michael,I have had to rearrange everything so it has taken me some time. I have had to make all of the legs individually instead of a transition. So I have used the cylinder example and swapped the make box item for making a single square face, then extruded the face in the meshing domain as this gives me a bit more freedom.I had to cut a few of my poor table legs in half to match some symmetry. I did this by cutting the square elements using a box (crude I know) but the final object looks correct. When I try to mesh these parts I get the error \"No base vertex parameter provided for a trilateral geometrical face\" which is odd because on the full surfaces no vertex has been chosen? There are no vertexes to chose from and I have tried to select them using the methods shown here;http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/224069755with no luck? I have attached a picture.The second issue is if I were to send my extruded legs and want them to merge with another surface on the other side so in this analogy the floor. I want to avoid inside faces, so the floor is currently meshed as a single face, but to account for the incoming mesh which will have many new faces how would you incorporate them into the floor? I have attached a pitcher too.Cheers,Seddon",

                "Hi SeddonTo avoid \"No base vertex parameter provided for a trilateral geometrical face\" error, rotate the legs that are cut by a symmetry plane, so that to get quadrangle faces only after the cut, like in the picture.To get a conformal contact between the legs and the floor, use the same approach as for the legs and the chair body. I.e. translate leg bases to the floor, apply Partition, and mesh the translated bases incorporated into the floor by using the same algo and hypotheses as for \"upper\" bases. In addition, after extruding the legs just till the floor, it will be necessary to Merge Nodes and Merge Elements.St.Michael",
                "Hi St Michael,I  have tried a lot of different methods to try and export a single volume of the chair, legs and floor without any success.So I meshed the bases into the floor and extruded the legs from the chair to the floor. Then using the mesh module I have two meshes, one for the floor and one for the legs and the chair. I then have to remove the pyramids so change these at this point in both meshes individually. I then make a compound mesh of the two meshes and click the merge box as you suggested. This then gives me 60 volumes, one for the chair one for the floor then 58 for legs (now they are all individual volumes). From this group I use the \"union groups\" option to place all of the volumes into one volume.I export the case to Openfoam and then use splitmesh to separate the legs from the other meshes, however openfoam only recognizes the chair and all of the other volumes are placed in separate mesh folders. I believe the reason for this is the creation of the tops and bottom faces during Salome, these faces create a plane which openfoam recognizes as another volume and thus splits them up. I have tried to not export the bases top and bottom, but this does not resolve the problem. I guess I need to understand the core differences within the mesh that would appear differently in a unv code meshing this way to as if the mesh was created as a single volume and meshed. A similar issue arises with the boxes within the disks, however this has not became an issue yet.Cheers,Seddon",
                "This has been resolved by invoking the cellZonesOnly command when using splitmesh. Previously splitmesh was doing a \"walk around\" of the surfaces and this is what was causing the issue of additional splitting up for anyone else who experienced this problem!"

                "Hi,1. As far as I know, there is no difference between a line and a edge in Salome. Both have a finite length.2. You don't have to \"use a shape type shortcut\". When an object is created, it is stored in a python variable. You just have to enter the name of the python variable to use it further in the script.To create a wire from a list of points, you can just call MakePolyline.Be careful, some functions are called with objects as parameters, whereas others are called with a list of objects (when there is no limit on the number of objects).3. Just use the name of the python variable you stored your object in (left of the equal sign). You can store them in a list or in a dictionnary to loop on them if you have to.Attached is your script fixed.You can get rid of the createAndDisplayGO lines. It slows down the writing of the script.Anyway it takes as argument the result of addToStudy (the id of the object in the object browser), not the name of the object you just added in the study.Christophe",

Sometime ago I had noticed that OF and Salome seem to conflict at some points.Removing OF from the PATH for the terminal session Salome used did mitigate the problem in my case. Maybe it is not as much a problem of Salome alone, but also of OpenFOAM. I assume: Salome is/was taking the existence of some libraries for granted which are there in standard systems. The OF-ThirdParty-package did not provide these but change the path, so Salome did not find the package because it was not available within the OF-PATH.How to mitigate the problem?1.) Do not load the OF-libraries on bootup but only when needed.2.) During packaging for Salome check if the PATH of OF does contain everything needed in the package.Either of the two steps should help...Cheers,Bernhard",

            "discussion": [
                "Hi,I'm trying to mesh a wing with a 3D tetrahedral mesh and a viscous layer for OpenFoam. I need some advice on how to approach it, as I'm new to Salome.What I've done so far:-I imported the geometry as a STEP file and created a bounding box around it. I created this box by subtracting the wing to a prism. Furthermore, I divided the domain in two volumes through partition, so I can refine the mesh near the wing. Thus, I've a small domain near the wing and a large domain far away from the wing (see attached picture).-For the meshing, I first mesh the faces of the wing with Netgen 2D-1D. Then, I mesh the small domain (refinement) using Netgen 3D with a viscous layer and Netgen 2D-1D. Finally,  I use Netgen 3D-2D-1D for the large domain.I've been able to generate some meshes after some trial and error with the min and max size of the elements. However, Netgen frequently crashes with the error messages \"overlapping boundary mesh\" or \"intersecting triangles\".

I need some advice on how to approach it, as I'm new to Salome.What I've done so far:-I imported the geometry as a STEP file and created a bounding box around it. I created this box by subtracting the wing to a prism. Furthermore, I divided the domain in two volumes through partition, so I can refine the mesh near the wing. Thus, I've a small domain near the wing and a large domain far away from the wing (see attached picture).-For the meshing, I first mesh the faces of the wing with Netgen 2D-1D. Then, I mesh the small domain (refinement) using Netgen 3D with a viscous layer and Netgen 2D-1D. Finally,  I use Netgen 3D-2D-1D for the large domain.I've been able to generate some meshes after some trial and error with the min and max size of the elements. However, Netgen frequently crashes with the error messages \"overlapping boundary mesh\" or \"intersecting triangles\".

I am surprised that Scalar.Def.Shape is not available to you!  When you right click on the solution field of say EQUI_ELGA_SIGM or similar do you not get a menu in which \"Deformed Shape and Scalar Map\" is the last choice just above Refresh [F5]?  If you do not see it then something is wrong with your installation of Salome.  What OS, version, 32/64bit, Salome version and install package are you using?  I may not be able to help much resolving it but perhaps others can.2. When I created the picture I posted earlier, I did create the deformed shape, deformed shape and Scalar.Def.Shape but I am not sure in what order.  Today I repeated it afresh and in the above sequence and I still get the same absurd image.  I am convinced there is a bug.3.

I will not be able to select surface mesh groups for applying boundary conditions in Openfoam.I try to do the following solution: To have a better control on the number of cells, I want to use quadrangle mapping where I can impose the number of nodes along the length of the duct on the 3 different surfaces. So I have 3 mapped meshed surfaces with conformal meshes. See attached pictureNext step is my problem, my plan was to use the 3 surfaces meshes with the option \"import 1D-2D elements from another mesh\" in a 3D netgen tets but it seems that it is not compatible. Maybe I need to convert surface mapped meshes into triangular elements before netgen generation? How can I do that?What is your advice? need some help.Best regardsJulien",

So now inlet and outlet surfaces are no more a problem.The remaining problem is how to deal with external wall surfaces, I don't know how to create the whole hex mesh in only one volume with the 3 external surfaces. I only see the solution to have 3 volumes...How can I manage to have only one final mesh if I have to split into 3 volumes? Is it possible to fuse the 3 meshes in one?Best regards",

(Don't hesitate to increase both tolerance of the shape to cut and of the tool shape)- The second is to use theOperations, Partitioninstead of make a cut. This tool allows to split shapes, and it works sometimes better than boolean operations. After the partition, you just have to explode the compound it creates and to extract the shape you want to keep. Logically, the ID of the shape to keep should be each time the same. Else you can make some test in your script to know which shape to keep (for example, checking the position of the center of mass).In addition, if you want to cut with a plane, you can use the \"partition with plane\" (second icon in the partition pop-up window). This is more robust and fast than the classical partition tool.Hope this helpBest regards,William",

                "Hello Eric,Although the Finite Element Method is only one and has a definite work flux (geometry definition, meshing, boundary conditions, solving, post-processing) different platforms assume different approaches to implement it. If you are coming from Ansys for example, you could be thinking that Salome is the equivalent of the pre-processing module, but that's not the case, simply because in this approach the boundary condition and material definition doesn't belong to the pre-processing part of the analysis but to the problem-definition-solvig part. This is a huge advantage if you want, for example, use the same mesh for different kind of analysis (thermic, elastic, plastic, modal) which don't share the same BCs and material properties. It is also a disadvantage if you want, for example, make a limit analysis on the load and change it in a scripting fashion or vary the material properties (is that your case?).That being said, the best you can do in your geometry-meshing script is to define the mesh groups where the BCs are going to be applied. Next, if you are using Code-Aster for the solving task, you really have to mess with the comm file. But don't be scared: if you achieved to build your own meshing script, that won't be hard. Remember that the comm file accepts python statements.",

Write a comm file according to your needs, or create it with Eficas (you can launch it from within Salome-Meca).2nd. For the calculation to work, you also need an export file, which you can create using ASTK. This one tells Aster wich comm file and mesh file to use, beside other parameters.3rd. For the automation part, make a call to the aster run script and pass the export file as argument, something like:subprocess.Popen(\"/YOURPATH/SALOME-MECA-2010.2-LGPL-i386/aster/bin/as_run exportFile.export\")4th.

The face is a square with a hole in the middle.Therefore the face is defined by two wires, one for the rectangle and one for the hole. When I try to use the quadrangle(mapping) algorithm I get a \"wrong number of wires:2\" message. I understand, that this algorithm per se is not able to mesh my face as a whole.I then tried to divide the face in half with an auxiliary line used as the \"tool\" in a partition operation. This way I get two faces, each of them having 3 straight sides and one with a semicircle \"dent\" in it. I then tried to mesh the half-faces but I get another error: I'm only allowed 4 edges per face, but I have 6.I then tried to create a unified edge from the \"dented\" side of the face, but fails with an error, that there are \"sharp bends\".So how do I get a quadrangular mesh for my face with a hole in it?Thank youp.s.: 100kb is hardly enough to get anyhting into a file",

What I get out of it is that they create four faces , each of them having four edges, one of them being a quarter arc, two diagonal lines and one straight edge. These four segments are them compunded to make up the entire face which can then be meshed.Is this really the easiest way to do this? It seems really complicated for a simple example like this and will be even more so for more complex geometries.",

What I want this to look like in the end isn't too complex at all, but I don't feel comfortable with Salome. When I see my co-workers do this in a day with their commercial software after only a day of training I get frustrated.The problem I have now when partitioning is that I get a circle cut into 4 slices and for more face segments which seem to have 4 edges for quadrangular meshing. So far so good. But one of the circular edges actually is made up of two instead of one edge. In meshing the algorithem then obviously complains about the excess edge and won't work.",

I tried so many different ways over the weekend i kind of lose track what way I followed in what file.So what I make out of your changes is:1. you use composite side discretion, which should allow the split arc to be treated as if it is one arc. I'm not sure how this helps, as it is a 1D algorithm, but it's the 2D alorithm that wa failing. So should we tell the 2D algorithm to treat the two split edges as one.2. You apply the quadrangle algorith to both, the circface and the surrounding face, I used the Radial Quadrangle 1D2D for the circface. I should have been more precise with what I intend this to use for. Eventually I want to FEA a water cooled heat sink. In this test case I set up the rectangular block as the heat sink and the tube in it is supposed to be the water filled cooling tube. As this is going to be a CFD-thermo coupled simulation I would like the Mesh for the water tube to have a certain appearance. The Radial Quadrangular 1D2D algorithm lets me make a mesh that is well suited for my purposes, as I can make it a very dense mesh at the outer region where I will have my boundary layer. So I would really like to use Radial Quadrangle because of it's cylindric symmetry, as my waterflow will also be symmetric.But when I use this algorithm with the composite side discretion I still have the same problem with the split edges.",

                "Hello Edward,what I did was creating arcs which works alright, it's just work. I am a step further now. Unfortunatly I, OF COURSE, have a new problem. My circle is now split into several segments. I created a group with all the segment faces and apply the radial quadrangle algo on it, using composite side discretion, because I want to have similarly spaced segments. I then want to use this segment group as a source face and project it to the end of my tube. This is when it fails. Eveything is fine except one segment which Salome does not want to project.Unfortunatly, Salome is so buggy, that I cannot make a python dump of my study and the hdf is too big for this forum. I'll try to create one from my Linux PC at home.",

I use the projection 2d-1d algorithm.when I launch that it only projects one of the four circle faces onto the back, the others fail with\"Projection_1D2D Sub shape #123, #133, #113, Can't apply source mesh pattern to the face\"Is it in general possible to use the projection algorithm on groups? Does it know, that the source faces have to be matched to certain target faces? Obviously say the bottom left front face must be used for the bottom left back face and not for the top right back face.  I tried to investigate in this direction, and it seemed that the algorithm by itself takes care of that.",
                "I try your scenario and see it's a bug of Projection algorithm.As a workaround, instead of Projection algo, you can simply assign same algo and hyps to groups of circle faces as I do in the attached script.Best regardsEdward",
                "Hi Edward and St Michael,thank  you two for your help. I ended up using the same algorithm on front and back side of my geometry and it works. Although the quadrangel mesh is not as I would wish it was. It uses very large area segments, I wish it had a max area constraint as the Mephisto does. So I ended up using Mephisto on the front an back side and quad on the sides, which means there is no need for splitting all my front and back faces into 4-edged segments. But I don't have cubic 3d elements anymore but extruded triangles. Not what I initially wanted, but I think I can live with it. Doing it like that makes life a lot easier.I must say that this was quite an unsatisfying experience using Salome. Some algorithms are buggy (projection), some are clunky (quadrangle), some features only work occasionally (python exports) and some just kill the program altogether (trying Netgens of any sort). But it's free software and for that it's pretty powerful and elaborate and if you know how to use it and get accustomed to its concepts it is suited for probably most CAD jobs."

The difficulty in reaching 0.05 here is that distance between vanes is too small while the 2D mesh is dense. Compare two pictures. The first one shows a internal surface of viscous layers in v7.4.0. The second one shows the same place in a current development version. You see, that layer inflation leads to a difficult situation near vane corners where elements are about getting distorted. The layer inflation stops since available smoothing methods can't untangle elements distorted near vane corners after a certain step of inflation.Note that the required 0.05 thickness is unreachable in principle as the distance between vanes is 0.1 ( = 2 * 0.05 ) only.While composing this message I tried to make the 2D mesh coarser by switching \"Limit size by surface curvature\" off and got the reached thickness even less than in v7.4.0-- there is still some problem. Hope I'll have time to cope with this issue by v7.5.0.Best regardsEdward"

Thus, what would happen if i did this and define the walls so they are the faces of the pipe (Am I clear in what I'm saying there?). I would then create two faces at the beginning and the end of the pipe with the correct diameter so they are the inlet and the outlet.2) In the Pipe tutorial video, he defines the first face (Group Name: F1), it is close to the end of the video. Why does he select the Sub-Shape 26 since it is smaller than the Sub-Shape 11? My point here is that if I want to have a fluid input on this side, then, the  Sub-Shape 11 includes all the input face of the pipe. So why including  the Sub-Shape 26?Regards,François.",
                "Hello,1) For what I understood, you can exactly follow the pipe tutorial. The thing to do is to think in terms of fluid not in terms of solid. This tutorial construct the solid region of the pipe (Construct the base part), the construted mesh is solid. In OpenFoam, you want the fluid region. Instead of an anular base you should only construct a simple circle and a face on it. Am I correct ? This what is done in tutorial video.You can also Extrude the circle along the path and then block the 2 holes. SALOME might have some functionnalities to do this.2) Because the base ofCylinder_1 (SubShape 26)is at the same position as (SubShape 11).Face_1might be (is?) cut into two subshapes.Inlethave to be the combination of those subshapes.Regards,Thomas"

Salome tells us: \"GetFaceByEdges : The given edges belong to several faces of the given shape\" but that edges belong only to one face!Can you help us to solve our problem?Thanks.Julie and Florent, student in an engineering school of geology",

The bolts are the same, and to create the assembly in Salome, I only need to import the two plates and one bolt. The three of them have been created in their own coordinate system, and are thus positioned one on top of each other once imported in Salome.Is there a way to create instances of these objects and handle only the position of these instances in Salome?Most notably for the bolt, I will need three instances of it and position them, so that when I save this assembly, the bolt and the plate geometrical definitions are saved only once, and only the positioning matrix for each of the instances is saved.It can have important effect on file size if you have to manage several time the same geometrical objects at different positions.Is this management of assembly possible in Salome?I thank you in advance for your answer.Best regards,Pierre",

Instead it simply makes an arc or an aproximated curve and not the contour I need.Besides that if the rise of the resulting curve would not change its sign ( in my example to make two parts ) , everything will beallright and the target face has a contour of four spline-edges.Unfortuntely I need the face as one part, to split it would make several difficulties.The platform is Salome 5.1.2 on Debian.I hope someone could give me a hind how I could solve my problem.Thanks,Robat",

This allows me to create fully parametric models that do not require remeshing, scaling, selecting new boundary conditions, etc...

When exporting to a mesh file, will the elements (faces in 2D) be topologically connected? That is, will the adjacencies be formed as I will expect?I have attached one of the meshes modified, so that I have two numbered elements. Will these two elements be considered as adjacent? In another words, will they share the same two vertices and the same edge?If so, how would face 2 be represented? It will have 5 nodes, as if it was a pentagon?Hope I have made myself clear, and that these are not extremely nooby questions (I have searched those things but couldn't find much)Thanks",

I need at least two layers of tetrahedra in y direction where the box is flat, giving me a rather small mesh width. But in x and z directions, the mesh width need not necessarily be that small.I have tried with netgen 1d-2d-3d and a local mesh size at the lateral (flat) faces of the box. I then get my two layers on the flat faces. But in xz plane, as we move to the center of the box, the mesh width gets larger, which is principally OK. But it gets larger also in y direction, which results in only one layer of tetrahedra also in y direction.How do I tell SMESH to use different mesh widths in y and x-z directions?Thanks,Matthias",

In my experiment, this is the best way to be sure you will have the desired number of layers.For complex shapes, you will have to use GHS3D (commercial product) to set the minimum of layers between two faces (via proximity detection).Christophe",

What can I do to avoid this?BTW in a presentation at the Salomé user meeting last year I have seen a mention of a planned gmsh plugin. Does anybody know what is the status of that one? Since netgen seems to be the only free 3D mesher contained in Salomé, it wopuild be good to have the gmsh algorithms available.Thanks,Matthias"

This can be useful to create the boundary group the more difficult to select in the 3D window, creating a group containing all faces and cutting it with other boundary groups.To create a face group containing all boundary faces of a Mesh, you can use: right-click on the mesh in the study tree, thenCreate boundary elements, checkingCreate group(at the bottom).Best regardsWilliam"

I am aware that I need create \"block geometries\" (6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices) to create a hexahedral mesh. I created a 2D sketch in Shaper (Sketch 1) and extruded it. Then, on one of the faces, I created an O-grid sketch (Sketch 2), and extruded it to create a cylinder. I would like to create a hex mesh; however, once the solids/blocks are created, I cannot move the vertices of these blocks to connect them to other blocks.Additionally, I would like to connect the vertices of the O-grid to another block to create a fine mesh near the walls on the hexahedrons. You may see how the wireframe of the cylinder is currently disconnected from that of the rest of the geometry (See Wireframe). The mesh created with two different partititions is also shown (See Mesh). Can these blocks be created/modified in Shaper? Or does this have to be done in Geometry or the Mesh module?

There is something I don't understand : using TUI logically there is no other way of distinguishing objects than through their name.In one of the examples a geometry is built from scrap (vertex, line, face, shell, solid) and then, in order to be able to define groups, it is split into its subcomponents with \"explode\". The group is then defined on edge1 which has been chosen with the following command:edge = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/box1/Edge_6\").GetObject()My question is, how does the user know that he's interested in \"Edge_6\" ? Isn't there a way ofchoosing the edge that rather corresponds to \"Line_1\" with which the solid was built ? Or is thereanother logic to find one's way through the objects ?Thx fellow Salome users, have fun !",

                "Hi every salome users,I would like to discuss two new features of 5.1.4 which does not appear in release notes (it is my own fault, I have not read them enough carefully).1. The GIBI driver in MED module is now able to read castem file save in native castem format (i.e. the xdr format). More precisely, before 5.1.4, to save a file readable in salome from castem you have to precise OPTI SAUV FORMAT 'foo.sauv' now it is not necessary to precise FORMAT. Note that the write part of GIBI driver still save formatted files.Note for windows users : The import sauv facility in SMESH and VISU works now with xdr files.2. The local sizes feature has been added in NETGEN smesh plugin. A new tab 'local sizes' has been added in netgen hypothesis dialog box. You can add a local size on vertices and edges. Note that it is not necessary these vertices and edges to be sub-shape of the shape to mesh. For instance, to refine at middle of a face, you just have to create a vertex at the wanted position and add a local size on this vertex. To achieve that, just select the vertex in study and click \"On Vertex\" in local size dialog box.Note for windows users : On windows, the 4.9.13 version of netgen is used. Within the version, you can add a local size on faces too. The only difference with previous ones is that the considered faces must be sub-shape of the main shape.Best regards,Erwan.",

It cannot be transmitted transparently between these modules directly through the Salome TUI or GUI without the \"save/read MED file\" step.=> How do you manage it? Can SMESH and VISU call MEDMEM library and did you implement access to this MEDMEM SAUV interface then in SMESH & VISU?Finally, the last question (maybe it is nonsense if xdr file format do not allow to save several increments in a single file): you indicate that you can import xdr file in SMESH: if there are several mesh states for the different increments in the xdr file, which one is considered to import the mesh in SMESH?Erwan, I deeply thank you in advance for the popssible tips you can provide.Bests,Pierre",

                "Hey everybody,I'm quite new to Salome as well as CAD and Meshing in general and hope that someone is able to help me out.The geometry I am building is a a solid prism with a triangular base (the edges are actually curved). The prism is surrounded by a solid box.Now I am meshing the partition of the solid prism and the solid block with a cut prism. The meshing is Automatic 2D Triangulation with 1D Automatic Length of fineness 0.2 as hypothesis.After that I try to group the mesh into the two geometric objects. So I am choosing to group by the filter \"Belong to Geom\" and choose the corresponding object (prism or box). It turns out the the triangles of the interface either belong to one of the geometries and not to both. Is there a way to get them in both groups anyway?And maybe the even more important question. If the geometry consists of objects then a surface element should belong to either of them. In my case \"Belong to Prism\" is not equal to \"Not Belong to Surrounding Box\" and vice versa. Why is this the case?I am sorry if I am not able to make clear enough what my problem is.I attached the Python Dump to illustrate the problem. The naming convention is as it follows:prism = Pillarsurrounding Box = CutBoxPartition of both = PillarAndCutBoxIn the mesh group \"Pillar\" you can see that some elements in one upper corner are missing which aren't in the CutBox group as well.Thank you very much for your help and have a good evening.Dominik",
                "Hi DominikAs itrecently appeared,  FT_BelongToGeom works differently depending on whether a threshold shape is a sub-shape of the meshed geometry or not.I suspect that in your case the threshold shape is a mix of sub-shapes and non-sub-shapes,  because within the Partition there are some faces got from Pillar and others got from CutBox. Hence you get a strange result.To get mesh faces you need, it's necessary to do some additional steps in GEOM in order to get faces of Partition corresponding to Pillar and CutBox. In GUI, to get faces corresponding to Pillar,  you can create a group of faces using \"Only sub-shapes of the second shape\" = Pillar option.I modified the script using this approach.St.Michael",

You can do it thanks to theNew Entity > Explodetool of theNew Entity > Group > Createtool.2) Then, the second step is to clean extracted geometry. Faces should be perfectly clean and touching each other. I think I saw there are some gaps. This should be fixed. You  must also avoid small faces. So, you can delete and rebuild whatever you want with the (powerful) Salome CAD tools instead of just filling holes with new very small faces. TheOperations > Partitiontool can help doing this.3) Third step is to create missing faces (inlets + outlets).4) Then, when all faces surrounding the domain are ready, you have to put them in aNew Entity > Build > Shell. And, from this shell, to create aNew Entity > Build > Solid.5) Finally, you have to create groups on your solid describing boundary conditions (inlet_1,outlet_1, etc.).Then, load theMeshmodule, select your domain, go toMesh > Create Mesh, then click onAssign a set of hypotheses > 3D: Automatic Tetrahedralization, theOK,Apply and Close, then right-click on your mesh andCompute.To never forget: right-click on your mesh and selectCreate Groups from Geometry, then select your boundary groups (inlet_1,outlet_1, etc.),Apply and Close, and that's all.Export your mesh inUNVformat and you are ready for the OpenFOAM partBest regards,William",

My best guess is that there's some minimum element size threshold below which the wire discretization algorithm is not effective. The line I'm trying to mesh is 50 microns or 5e-5 in length. Is my hypothesis reasonable? Does Salome have a hard time with numbers below a certain value? If so, is there a workaround?

If I right-click Mesh_1 and export or if I use File --> Export --> UNV, then I get the entire mesh created for Partition 1, not just the Solid_1 and Solid_2 regions.  Is it possible to just export the mesh for the Solid_1 and Solid_2 regions to a single UNV file?  Thank you very much.\n\n- ffan",
                "Hello,I did not noticed you have more sub-shapes thanSolid_1andSolid_2inPartition_1... Sorry for that.So, you have two ways to proceed.1- First, you can  redo a new mesh on a new geometrical object containing onlySolid_1andSolid_2. (The best way)You can do it by putting bothSolid_1andSolid_2in aNew Entity > Build > Compound.Then, to be sure shared faces are fused  (so as to have a conforming mesh), you should use theRepair > Glue Facestool on your new compound. (It is possible no face have to be glued.)Then, you can \"explode\" Solid_1 and _2 again, create a new mesh and export it in UNV format.2- The second option is to delete elements of your existing mesh you don't want to export.You can first create a node group with all nodes in it:Mesh > Create Group, thenElements Type=Node,  checkSelect Alland click onApply And Close.Then, select both mesh groupsSolid_1andSolid_2and go toMesh > Group of underlying entities. Choose aResult name(eg. \"to_keep\") and click onApply And Close. This should create a group with nodes you want to keep.You can now  cut your first group (\"Group_1\") with the other one, going toMesh > Cut Groups.Once you have a group containing nodes to delete, you can right-click on it and selectDelete Groups with Contents.Before exporting your mesh (Mesh_1), you should delete resting node groups (simply using the[DEL]key), and keep only volume groupsSolid_1andSolid_2.In case of mistake, you can right-click on your mesh, selectClear Mesh Dataand compute it again.Best regards,William",

I guess you want to access some of existing groups built on your \"Simulation_Domain\" object - there are three groups there: \"symmetry\", \"inlet\", \"exit\".If this is what you want, you can do this with the following script:import salomesalome.salome_init(\"DCS.hdf\")from salome.geom import geomBuildergeompy = geomBuilder.New(salome.myStudy)g_symmetry = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByName(\"symmetry\", \"GEOM\")[0].GetObject()g_exit     = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByName(\"exit\", \"GEOM\")[0].GetObject()g_inlet    = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByName(\"inlet\", \"GEOM\")[0].GetObject()Note, however, that this way is not quite good - in case if you have several same-named objects in your data tree, this approach returns only first found items (see \"[0]\" index in the commands).Another approach is to use FindObjectByPath() method and point full path to the object, for example:g_symmetry = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/Simulation_Domain/symmetry\").GetObject()This way, though, has the same disadvantage as previous one, but only in case if you have several objects that have exactly the same \"path\".Regards,Vadim.",

I want to split a mesh in two parts: one meshed manually and the other with algorithms.I tried the following strategy but it fails:- In the geometry, create two volume groups having the shape of the different areas (to mesh manually and with algorithms)- Create a void mesh- Mesh a face- Make a revolution of this face to fill the first volume geometrical group- Create a mesh group including the resulting 2D elements of this mesh on the rest of this revolution- Create a submesh with the 2D algorithmUse Existing 2D Elements(What is the difference withUse Existing Faces?) to 'copy' the manually generated 2D element on the submesh.- Here, I would like to mesh the other geometrical volume group with algorithm, but I don't know why, some elements (3D and 2D) of my manually generated mesh are deleted...Difficult to be clear just by words...Enclosed is a dump study of this case...

                "First, thank you very much for your answer and sorry for the lack of precision in my questions.Previously Saint Michael wrote:How can i mesh a face with more than 4 edges with a rectangular cells ?It is possible only if a faces has 4 smooth (the tangent vectors at each point \"on the right\" and \"on the left\" are collinear with the same orientation) sides but consisting of several edges.Ok, in fact i use more than 4 edges in some cases but only with 4 smooths edges,How does the 1D hypothesis Nb Segments with Scale Distribution ?S - scale factor, N - nb segments, L - edge length.A = S**(1/(N-1)),L0 = L * (1 - A)/(1 - A**N) - length of the 1st segmentL1 = L0 * A, L2 = L1 * A, ...Ok i was in the right path thinking that it uses geometric progression. But it's nice to know really how this algo works because we can have a good control over the 1D meshing and the definition of a good first cell dimension,Is it possible to mesh an edge by giving the first cell dimension and a scale factor between this cell and the next cell ?No. \"Start and End Length\" hypothesis realizes geometric progression but length of the last segment is given instead of the scale factor.Damned, i managed an excel tool to use the number of segment with scalefactor to do the same instead of using this simple algo.In gambit there are some use-full algo like double spacing. How can i manage a double spacing mesh with salomé using only 1 edge ? For example for a 2D channel. I think that i can use density function, but i don't really understand how it works.Could you explain what \"double spacing\" and \"2D channel\" are (I don't know \"gambit\", sorry).In fact, the double spacing algorithm is a geometric progression algorithm but you can specify a first lenght for each side of the edge that you want to mesh. For example, with a 2 D channel, you have to refine your mesh near the walls. With this algorithm you can refine near each wall and having a geometric progression to the center of the channel.Now, with my knowledge of Salomé i have to create two edges for a smooth edge and create a geometric progression for each edge of my smooth edge. I think that another way is to use density profile, but i don't know how to manage this hypothesis to have a geomtric progression for my mesh near the two opposite sides.In gambit, we have the possibility to mesh a face and adding Wall boundary mesh (for refinement in fact). Is it possible to do the same with Salomé ?Could you explain in more detail what you need? What is \"Wall boundary mesh\"? If it is 1D elements on face boundary, then it is possible and even inevitable since 2D elements are generated basing on discretization of face edges.In gambit, you can mesh a face using the generation of a mesh based on discretization of edges like in Salomé in fact. But you can add a wall boundary condition for meshing. This mesh will replace the general face mesh near an edge by refining the mesh. In this region, the solver will apply turbulence wall law to modelize the turbulence near walls.But, i'm not sure that it's really usefull for me. In fact, i used gambit and fluent in the past, but now i use salomé and Saturne for CFD cases. So, as i don't know how Code Saturne manage its turbulence wall laws, may be it's not usefull.Best regards.JMB",

It is a complex geometry, but let's say that it is a big box with some objects inside and I want to have an inlet and an outlet for an air flow.When I import my geometry (wich was made using Catia) I only have one compound in my geometry.So I try to explode it. I try to explode it in compound/solid/face... The best one was by compound even if it was not perfect I had  4 sub-shapes. Then I have to explode those sub-shapes in face in order to find my inlet-outlet and wall.My main difficulty is that I will have a lot of difficulty to find the correct face for my inlet/outlet since I have something like 200 items.The other problem is that I do not seem to have a volume, but an empty shell. It's like I don't have the air in my 'box'.I hope that you will understand my problem and hopefully someone will be able to help me.",
                "Hello RomainAs about selecting inlet and outlet face, you can use the attached script to publish in the study only needed faces, which can be found by their names.As about the second problem, I believe everything is OK with your box. Just to do what you need.St.Michael",

Face 200 when I explode my compound, so I am not \nsure that the script will be able to help me. And I am  not sure that I \nreally have this face since it seems to me that I only have the external\n wall of my box  but not the internal volume nor the inlet or outlet.Thanks again,Romain",
                "Ok, I seem to see what is your problem. I would advise you to change your model in CATIA by removing the box from it. Then import internal staff of your model in Salome, create a new box in Salome, perform Partition of the box and the internal staff (select everything as \"Object\"). As a result you get a compound of solids.Then you create a group of faces for wall, inlet and outlet. \"Create group\" dialog lets you limit selection to shapes geometrically coincident with other shapes (by activating option \"Geometrical parts of the Second Shape\" in \"Main Shape Selection restriction\" group), using which you can find faces of the box within the compound of solids made by Partition. For this, first you create a group of all faces of the box (let's call it 'box faces'), then, when you create a wall group, you select the 'box faces' group as \"Second Shape\" (-> only 6 faces will be shown) and thus you can select wall faces (or inlet/outlet) easy.St.Michael",
                "You shouldn't export the air with Catia. Just export the other volumes and make a partition to generate the air in Salome. Anyway you'll have to partition your geometry.Another problem using Catia is the construction lines, eg. for cylindrical shapes. In some cases, it can be very close to the true edges, but not merged and generate errors (but more likely at the meshing step).",

The main difficulty is that I want the resulting mesh to \"respect\" the internal surface between the two colors (like in the case of a finite element mesh for a solid with different materials, that is to say that no element is allowed to cross the surface).I am not an expert in meshing and I don't know how to do this with Salome. Should I mesh each part independently and do something (what?) to ensure compatibility at the red-yellow surface? Should I have a unique geometric 3D object to be meshed with the surface constraint (how?) ?NB: I join the .hdf an a python script to generate this geometry (it can be modified very simply to have a unique solid instead of the red part and the yellow part of the .png).Thanks,Best regards,Olivier",

                "Hoi Olivierdifferences between meshing of compounds and partition:compounds will generate two different meshes that are in no way related to each other. If there is a coincident plane/border normally the meshes will have different nodes in the same plane.a partition will be meshed as one single component. The border between the two (or more) parts will be respected when meshing the complete construction: no elements will cross the border. Nodes on the coincident borders will be shared by the elements on each side of the border, eg to apply different material properties.Compounds can be 'glued' together in an FEA program if needed. Mesh size etc. can be independent for each compound.Partitions donot need this since they share the nodes.Compounds are easier in meshing but need more attention during FEAnalysis.Partitions need more attention during meshing but are -generally speaking- easier in FEAnalysiskind regards - kees",

Even not sure it should be posted here rather than in a Python forum, but here it is :Attached is the (much) simplified version of a script I use to build arrays \nof geometrical objects (just simple boxes for example). Here I show the bug with a \nclass \"aBox\" containing two attributes : one geometrical object \"myBoxes\", and one *array* of geometrical objects : \"myCutr\".In this test, I try to initialize an array of objects \"aBox\", \ncontaining each a simple cube \"tiBox\" for \"myBoxes\", and anarrayof 1 \nelement \"tiBox\" for \"myCutr\". This way, an instance should contain two \nidentical grids, one with the myBoxes, and one with the same cubes contained at address myCutr[0], for each of the elements of the array aBox[I]The initialization is performed through a loop. When I check inside the loop, the arrays of myBoxes and myCutr[0] are identical... OK !Once the initialization is performed, it appears that all the array elements myCutr have been replaced by the last one.If you run the attached script inside Salome, you will get six objects for the test :This is the initialization performed :myBoxes0myCutr_0_1 : Two cubes at x=0myBoxes1myCutr_1_1 :  Two cubes at x=1Notice that  myCutr_0_1 is placed as myBoxes0, at x=0Now control after the initialization :myCutr_0_2 : Replaced by the last element myCutr_1_2... this is the bugmyCutr_1_2 : Correctly placedthis class aBox is used in more complex objects, with more complex arrays and geometrical objects, but the result is always the same : such arrays of geometrical objects inside a class appear systematically replaced by their last element.Did I something wrong in my specifications ?

(Shame that the tutorial didn't explain that method and only focused on mefisto - that's why I wasn't trying anything else, by thinking that the tutorial shows the best possible way)About \"Repair > Remove Extra Edgestool\" in my case and for the \"final shape\" {flow around spheres} after usage of that tool i receive totally deformed shape.Althought, shape of mesh looks better, I can't get through the problem that the \"flow\" {final mesh - object around all spheres} during compiuting has the problem:p, li { white-space: pre-wrap;\"Projection_1D2D_3\" failed on \"Spherical Face_13\". Error: Algorithm failed. Can't apply source mesh pattern to the face.Spherical Face_13 is the face of sphere which is inside of my model.Do you have any idea what is wrong or what i can do more to solve that problem?Thank you againAndrzej M Prusiński",
                "Hello Edward,At the first moment i was suprised cause the mesh is perfectly done in *.hdf file but i can't get same result from script in the model.py file. I assuming, based on what you said, that there was some bug-fix, but i don't really know how to install it {upgrade salome}. Could you tell me what to do or at least where i can find any info about what to do to install fix?Best reagardsAndrzej M Prusiński"

                "Hi Micke,I have reproduced the issue you're describing. We'll try to see why it happens.In the meantime, you can use the alternative way to create groups by selecting sub-shapes with a point coordinates, for instance:Group_5 = model.addGroup(Part_1_doc, [model.selection(\"FACE\", (0, 5, 5))])To generate the dump with this alternative selection mechanism, you can call the feature dump (from the Part menu), it will generate a file with _geo.py suffix.Best regards,Christophe",

                "Hello,I was pretty certain you would ask about the appli sessionFirst, I invite you to consult the documentation of KERNEL. The Salome application concept is described there. Here are some explanations:From an installation of Salome, you can create as many virtual applications as you want. A virtual application has many advantages, for example it allows you to choose which module you want to have when running Salome.To create an application, you should have a script createApplication.sh in you Salome installation directory; it depends on the downloaded version: InstallWizard (I don't know) or universal binaries (the script exists), ...You can also create an application on your own. All you need is a file called config_appli.xml (you have a sample in KERNEL_ROOT_DIR/bin/salome). Then just call the script KERNEL_ROOT_DIR/bin/salome/appli_gen.py.At the end you will have a bunch of symbolic links pointing to your Salome installation, and some useful scripts.To run Salome: ./runAppli (it behaves like runSalome)To run a Salome appli session: ./runsession (it launches a new bash session with all the Salome environment). Once in a session, just type assistant to run the Qt assistant bundled with Salome's Qt.A Salome appli session is useful to have a compatible and real Python console. For example:$ ./runsession[NS=localhost:2810]$   ==> note that the prompted is changed[NS=localhost:2810]$ pythonPython 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Apr  4 2011, 23:43:49)[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.>>> import user # to have automatic completion using the tabWhen you are in the Salome application session, you are \"linked\" to an existing Salome application. The session above is linked to the Salome study running on the CORBA port 2810 (this is the first Salome launched). This means that you can interact with the study.For example say you have a built a box Box_1 which has an entry 0:1:1:1 (right click in the object browser column title to display the entry column). In the python of the application session you can retrieve the box and create another one by translation :>>> import salome>>> salome.salome_init(1) # beware to use the correct study id>>> b = salome.IDToObject(\"0:1:1:1\") # this is a CORBA object>>> import GEOM>>> box = b._narrow(GEOM.GEOM_Object) # narrow the CORBA object to the real object>>> import geompy>>> geompy.init_geom(salome.myStudy)>>> box2 = geompy.MakeTranslation(box,100,100,0)>>> geompy.addToStudy(box2,\"box2\")'0:1:1:2'Refresh the object browser, you will see the new box.Best regards,Gilles",

Maybe in the next release.Best regardsEdwardHi Edward,Thanks for your kind reply. Hopefully you will add this feature for the next verstion.Regards, ChenPlease Fix this issue ASAP, it is nonsense to rename nodes and elements from 1 to maxElements when exporting DAT only because someone complained about having holes in the mesh.If someone has holes in the mesh they should rename all nodes and elements ID's and this will close the gaps and then export to DAT file and not to export the DAT renumbering the node/elements.Some people (I include myself) use holes in the mesh because it is very useful to have different node/element numbering for certain elements in order to distinguish where the node/element belong to, for example 4xxxxxxx on shaft, 7xxxxxx on gears and so on.When I tried to export the Mesh using version 9.6 I got the disgusting surprise that the export renames my nodes/elements.Renaming the model while exporting is a Rookie way of doing things.Please fix at the next version, I am working for mathematical modeling for more than 25 years and this is the first time I saw such a bad thing to rename the mesh while exporting without the user control.Thank you"

                "Dear SALOME specialists,although I'm using SALOME since 2.5 years I'm not familiar with the ways\n of reparing a mesh in the SALOME and therefor I'm asking for your help. I have a 3D mesh generated from an MRI scan. As this mesh is not intended to be used for a FE analysis it partially consists of distorted elements that of course lead to problems during the computation (singular stiffness matrix in my case). Please find an image attached that shows a badly-shaped part of the mesh I'm dealing with. I know how to create a submesh in SALOME by choosing a specific part of the geometry that I want to remesh. Unfortunately I have to work directly on the mesh as I don't have an underlying geometry, i.e. I directly start working in the Mesh module by importing the mesh.I'm looking for a way to remesh the region of the mesh that you can see in the attached image. Is there any way of doing this (without having access to the geometry) in the Mesh module or is there another way in SALOME? I was thinking about using HOMARD for this issue but if I understood it correctly, HOMARD is intended to be used during a computation and not in preprocessing. Is that right or am I able to use HOMARD to remesh all parts of the mesh exceeding a certain - let's say - aspect ratio? I definetly want to repair the mesh in a preprocessing step.Best regards and many thanks,Ralf",

HOMARD will\nsplit any element that is inside this zone and solve the problems of\nthe pending nodes. Doing that, the initial quality is kept: whatever it\nis good or not!

                "Hello Martin,Unfortunately, there is no any \"how-to\" document that would provide a description of the module implementation specifically for Windows platform. Existing tutorials relate to the Linux platform only.The main problem is that from its origin SALOME was mainly aimed to the Linux platform and, thus, used build system based on GNU auto-tools (autoconf / automake / libtool / GNUmake). For building SALOME on Windows, CMake was later used that allowed generation of MS Visual Studio solutions. CMake input files are generated from the Makefiles by hand-made Python script. Unfortunately, this script contains some hardcoded staff and, thus, cannot be considered as universal solution that would be appropriate for any custom 3rd-party module. However, it might work in simple cases.On the other hand, you can refer to PARAVIS as an example of the module, completely based on CMake, that makes cross-platform solution for both Linux and Windows.So, you have two choices:1) Take PARAVIS as example of the module based on CMake. Note that PARAVIS is very specific case of SALOME module, so you only need to refer to it for the build procedure.2) Create GNU auto-tools -based module following the description provided in SALOME Tutorial and try am2cmake procedure for converting Makefiles to CMake. If needed, you can also attune am2cmake script for your own purposes, though this might be not an easy task.Regards,Vadim.",

In the geometry section you ll define (with the function create group) the sphere as solidRegion and the fluidRegion (you ll get simply making a cut boolean operation with the box and the sphere) as a fluidRegion. In the mesh section u have to do the same.you convert to openFOAM environment using:  >> ideasUnvToFoam, then >> splitMeshRegions -cellZones -overwrite and that's all.

                "Hello, everyone. Nice to see you.I am a CAD engineer trying to introduce CodeAster to my daily works.To achieve this, I am writing the (unstructured) mesh file converter between our daily tool and CodeAster using MEDCoupling library (shipped with Salome-meca 2017 stable release).In our daily tool, mechanical boundary conditions can be assigned to certain part of external face, and individual points.So I've implemented them as level -1 group (contact) and node group to MEDFileMesh, which contains corresponding level 0 and -1 MEDCouplingUMesh.Of course cell groups are also added to assign mechanical parameters to each material (region).Checking with getGroupsOnSpecifiedLev() shows they are successfully added as follows:info of cell groupsregion oxfilm : number of contents = 363850region wafer : number of contents = 3267448info of face groupscontact back : number of contents = 7920info of node groupsnode bottomend : number of contents = 1node pointend : number of contents = 1node topend : number of contents = 1But after call of MEDFileUMesh::rearrangeFamilies() (recommended in document and code), a node group \"back\", which seems containing all nodes, appears suddenly and inexplicably:info of cell groupsregion oxfilm : number of contents = 363850region wafer : number of contents = 3267448info of face groupscontact back : number of contents = 7920info of node groupsnode back : number of contents = 672789node bottomend : number of contents = 1node pointend : number of contents = 1node topend : number of contents = 1And this node group seems to \"shadow\" (or override) the face group with same name \"back\" at saving to file.Thus necesarry GROUP_MA information is lost.But if I omit this call, CodeAster failes with exception deep in the core - so it seems this call is mandatory.Could you please tell me what is happening and how can I fix this?Any advices are hugely welcome.Thanks,Yutaka Nishizawa",

By doing so, I get something like this:http://oi59.tinypic.com/24g2btu.jpg* I added the red lines (also extruded along the width/heigth of the prism) in order to have four edges and be able to use hexahedron algorithm.The problems are that the circle/cylinder transforms into a square/prism (not sure if it always happens or I just didn't define a small enough length for it), and the that the resulting mesh is not exactly what I expected.The radius of the circle is only 1 mm, and it belongs to a face which is at least 10 cm long, where the sides of the squares in the hexagonal mesh are no smaller than 5 mm . So I guess it's necessary to use tetrahedrons in the circle/cylinder, but I need the tetahedrons to be only in the circle/cylinder (and maybe surrounding it until the triangles sides are as big as the squares ones). That's actually my problem, I don't know how to join both meshes.Hope you can help me. Thanks in advance,J.C.",

Because of this, the orientation of the edge is important. When you create your hypothesis, you can see the orientation of edges in the 3D window. You can then select them and click on Add.

                "Hello,I was going to edit my last post but you replied before I could do it.Another \"question\". It looks like when I use the 1D algorithm  'scale factordistribution', the length of the hexahedron sides have \"no limit\". It increases if I increase the 'scale factor'. I thought global hypothesis 'Local_length' would work, but it didn't (two of the outter  squares sides where longer than 5 mm), or I did it wrong (might be because sub-mesh has priority over the global mesh?). So what I think is that the solutions are modifying (increasing) the number of elements or increasing he scale factor. Is that correct? Is there any other way?I've attached what I've done. There are 3 vertical (Z-axis) divisions in the prism because I need to apply some boundary conditions in those specific points/edges. How is it? Is there a better way to mesh that geometry?Thanks in advance. Regards,J.C.",

Using any and same algorithm for both of them will undoubtedly connect the neighboring nodes.Problem:Selecting (Create mesh->1D--->Wire Discretisation--->Max Length) small sized elements will only define the geometry of the cylinder properly and using same algorithm for other larger structure will unnecessarily create a bulky mesh. I just want to get rid of this bulkiness by defining same algorithm on the surfaces which are connected and different where they are not connected. I tried to use sub-mesh tool but gave me nothing.

For example: localized element concentration occurs in some regions. This simply increases the number of elements in the mesh.

Since you are interested in the Geometry and Mesh application, I suggest that you start by checking out the scripting section of the User Documentation of those apps:http://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/gui/GEOM/geompy_page.htmlhttp://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/gui/SMESH/smeshpy_interface_page.htmlAlso, I really recommend you to use the Dump Study functionality of Salome. Create a simple box and mesh it in the GUI, then press Ctrl-D and save the Python script (see attachments). This Python script contains the \"steps\" that are necessary to create the box and the mesh. The parts of the script from Dump Study that are necessary to setup a working environment are:import salomesalome.salome_init()theStudy = salome.myStudyThe GEOM componentimport GEOMfrom salome.geom import geomBuildergeompy = geomBuilder.New(theStudy)The SMESH componentimport  SMESHfrom salome.smesh import smeshBuildersmesh = smeshBuilder.New(theStudy)The lines of code that are in between depends on what you want to do.You try to make some small changes to the script and then load it into Salome (Ctrl-T) to see what happens. This way you can successively learn what the functions does and how to use them. If you want to read what a specific function does and which arguments it takes, search for that specific function in the API documentation:http://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/gui/GEOM/geompy_doc/namespacegeomBuilder.htmlSometimes the documentation is well-written and easy to understand, other times it is frustratingly ambiguous or insufficient (but you rarely have to check the source code).I hope that this was what you were asking and that it was easy to understand.

If you detect some bugs or misses any feedback is welcome. It is possible to make a MED mesh with MEDCoupling/MEDLoader.

                "Hi Anthony,Thank you for your answer.I have to explain a bit the purpose of my previous post.The current MEDMEM library offers several drivers towards different formats (GIBI, VTK...), and having in mind to developp additionnal drivers to handle new formats where mesh, group and field data are also managed, we tried to implement a 1st driver in MEDMEM.However, it turned out that developping a \"reader\" driver from one format to a MED object is a \"nightmare\": the tools to fill the MED data structure in MEDMEM are far from being flexible...In SMESH, it seems that an intermediate data structure (more flexible to create and fill), specific to SMESH, is used when importing an external format. Then, a single interface between this intermediate format and MED has been created once and for all.We have in mind to follow the same approach when implementing new drivers in MEDMEM. In this case, maybe ParaMEDMEM and/or MEDCoupling libraries may already offer such a more convenient and flexible intermediate format.What do you think: is it of any sense to implement new MEDMEM drivers in MEDMEM library using these \"external\" libraries\"?One of the current limit one can see is the lack of group management in these \"external\" libraries.I thank you in advance for your feedback.Bests,PierrePS: also, for someone external to the Salome project, all these libraries allowing to handle MED objects in different ways is like a jungle... (SMESH intermediate data structure, MEDMEM, ParaMEDMEM, MEDCoupling, and I'm quite sure the Post-Pro module has also its own way to do....) Is it foreseen in the future to have like a \"unification\" of these tools, a shared library between all these component?If yes, is the trend to follow already known?That is to say, if new drivers would have to be developped, which library would be the most appropriate location?I thank you in advance for your advice.Bests,",
                "OK, I see. Some history is needed... MEDMEM was designed to fit as much as possible MED file data structure. Then the users wanted to couple with this data stucture because this data structure was the only available. But it appears that it was not a very good idea. First of all MEDMEM is linked to MEDFile and so to HDF5. A code that is already linked to HDF5 with a different version of HDF5 can't use MEDMEM, even if you MEDMEM use whitout drivers ! MEDMEM::MESH is not a datastructure for interpolation, MEDMEM::MESH type policy management is not easy as you have seen...The idea now is to split DataStructure clearly from drivers, and to offer an independant light data structure for coupling.This is what is done by MEDCoupling and MEDLoader. ( VTK do exactly the same thing. You can handle vtkUnstructuredGrid instances without any link to openGL nor HDF5...). But what I try to implement is most of functionalities to help to read/write a MED file. For example MEDCoupling allows mix of types contrary to MEDMEM. MEDCoupling offers capabilities of reordering by type automatically (usefull for MEDfile). MEDCoupling gives algorithm to partition meshes (for families for example). These functionnalities are used by MEDLoader to operate I/O.Concerning your last questions.- ParaMEDMEM is the parallele extension of MEDCoupling. ParaMEDMEM and MEDCoupling are DataStructures that have no prerequisites except MPI for ParaMEDMEM. Their first aim is the coupling. The salome component coupled in memory are ported to it. But they can handle fields and mesh for operations. MEDLoader and ParaMEDLoader are aditionnal tools for I/O. I'm working to put in MEDLoader all needed to make the most of MEDfile. This is nearly the case. All needed generic algorithms are put in MEDCoupling.- MEDMEM is the historical tool still used. I'm working on MEDCoupling/MEDLoader all the functionalities needed in order to offer to the users the possibility to avoid to use MEDMEM and its \"nightmare\" API as you said. I'm working with users to propose to them the most convivial API as possible to perform group/family setting... That's why I am interested in any feedback.- SMESH has a separate function. SMESH is intended to extensively perform meshes operations (addition/suppression of cells of any type, addition/suppressionnodes...). That's why MEDMEM  has not been used as data structure inside SMESH. I've integrated most of those in MEDCoupling. The idea of using MEDcoupling into SMESH was considered but we run presently out of time to do look at this deeply.So to respond to you question, personally I encourage you to implement your drivers using MEDCoupling. Maybe you will be lead to define some new class that will aggregate MEDCoupling classes. But all the cell type management, partitioning merge algorithm is done for you. MEDCoupling gives you memory management and plenty of tests.Bests",
                "Thank you very much for your answers Anthony.- A ?last? technical question then. Where would you advice to implement new driver classes then?Do you confirm that it is still meaningfull to implement new drivers in the MEDMEM name space (were the \"MEDMEM.GENDRIVER\" class is already implemented actually, and from which are implemented additionnal drivers), and to benefit from MEDCoupling data structure as intermediate data structure from the MEDMEM name space?I ask this question because after reading your answer, I don't clearly understand what will become the MEDMEM name space in the future? Will it become deprecated?- Also, could you maybe (to be sure to understand) explain just quickly what do you mean by \"MEDLoader and ParaMEDLoader are aditionnal tools for I/O. I'm working to\n put in MEDLoader all needed to make the most of MEDfile.\"?What do you call \"I/O\"? (what type of inputs and outputs?)- Finally (sorry, these will be 3 questions) do you know when group management tools will be provided in MEDCoupling?I thank you again for your answers.Have a nice evening.Bests,Pierre",
                "Sorry my response was not clear.1) Yes it's possible to implement a MEDMEM driver using MEDCoupling. But It's not classical at all(medmem is not linked to medcoupling !) MEDMEM will be kept for at least 2 years in Salome6. If MEDLoader API is not powerfull enough for you MEDMEM driver implementation is a good option. In this case I will appreciate if you indicate to me the missing functionalities. I'll try to integrate them in the next version of MEDLoader.2) I am working to implement classes in MEDLoader all needed to give to the user all the capabilities (group/family on multi level cell/node renumbering...) of MEDfile (more than MEDMEM. MEDMEM does not deals with renumbering) with a friendlier API. These classes are using only MEDCoupling.3) A group is just a collection of set of ids (cell face or edge or node) in MEDFile convention. A collection of DataArrayInt instances fully described this type of notion. That's why Group class will never appear in MEDCoupling library. DataArrayInt  gives method to perform operations withto emulate a group (merge,complement,substract,...). To be clear Group won't be implemented in MEDCoupling because not generic enough BUT group/family will appear in MEDLoader (see point 2) for MEDFile fan like youHave a nice evening too.Anthony"

                "Hello.I meshgas ducts of the heat recovery boiler(HRSG) withNetGenand I need \"inflation\" layers on thediffusor-shaped prismatic duct(sorry, I'm not allowed to share geometry). From \"Y+ based\" calculations and bulk mesh cell size I need 35 inflation layers with growth ratio 1.25 and summary width0.35 m. I built the mesh and performed calculations in Ansys (Meshing + CFX) and it's OK but I want to compare results with Code_Saturne on the NetGen mesh (Expensive vs Free solution, we use both).I built the mesh without inflation in Salome's NetGen and it seem to be OK (sizings, maximum 3D aspect ratio). But adding inflation layers turned out a very tricky task in freeware solution... Salome's mesher [I use NetGen 1D_2D + Tetrahedron(NetGen)] \"don't want\" to create the layers of more or lessacceptable summary with (or number of layers). I tried various combinations of settings and boundaries (walls) selection for inflation, I also increased the size of surface elements at \"inflated\" walls up to 0.2 m. It didn't help. As a result, the difference of final layer width and adjacent \"bulk\" mesh element size is abnormally high (20...30) that, IMHO, will produce distored results (I tested this issue on a simple cone-like geometry).Sorry, but in real simulation we usually don't have geometries like single spheres, cubes or cylinders. Prismatic duct is a relatively simple geometry. Why don't the mesher in Salome \"want\" to create appropriate layers? Am I missing something? Is it possible to \"say\" the mesher to begin with surface mesh and inflation layers and then fill the volume with tetras? IMHO, it will be more easy for the mesher then building the non-inflated mesh, shrinking it and add layers (it seems that it's default algorythm).Please don't be angry because of my words about real geometry. I like Salome and understand that it's free, so I must not demand any features. But it would be great if I could find the way to make inflation layers with required parameters.Thanks.",

Nevertheless, it should be enough to reproduce difficulties with prism layers. STEP file is in attachment.I also placed a simple domain scheme in archive (sorry, forum limit is 100K so I shrinked the picture). There must be inlet, outlet and prism layers on part of the wall surface (colored in pink in attached picture, please see archive contents).Required layers parameters: first layer height = 3.5*10^-5 m (0.035 mm), growth ratio = 1.25, number of layers = 35. Really it's required that the first layer height is small enough (to capture viscous sublayer) and final layer prisms are large enough for relatively smooth transition to tetras in \"bulk\" volume.Thanks for your attention and work.

It's in attachment alone withIGESfile (STEP created with SolidWorks is to coarce in circular edges and I didn't find an option to improve it). First picture shows layers on the top of thejunctionof cone-shaped (circular cross-section) and prism-shaped (rectangular cross-section) ducts. Second picture shows layerson inletwhere mesh sizing is applied (0.05 m cells to capture inlet velocity profile). Feel free to ask more mesh pictures.The tricky place is a cone-box junction mentioned above. In the STEP or IGES geometry you will see that the circular part diameter in this section is just sligtly smaller than the length of the side of the \"box\" part. NetGen processed this place correctly (but, BTW, it refused to apply a surface sizing on \"layered\" area that colored in pink on previous pictures). But possibly there is some difficulty for prism layers algorythm in this place that forces it to decrease summary prisms height.",

They not mandatory there but it was simpler to let the mesher to lay all surface except inlet and outlet with layers to avoid \"step issues\" in areas where layers are really needed. It turned out that inflation algorythm in Ansys mesher (Meshing applicationhow they officially call it) is quite smart. For example, if there is no room for layers in particular zone (gap), it gradually reduces the number of layers in this zone using wedge-shaped elements (see attach). Also, as I mentioned above, we use \"pre-inflation\" option that works remarkabely more stabe than post-inflation. If I get it right, in Salome indeed post-inflation is used that needs existing mesh shrinking and so is less flexible than pre-inflation.",

                "SMESH expertHello.Thanks for your reply.I'm not wondering that it's all OK on boxes. I tested your code on similar simple geometry (very simple diffusor). But, unfortunately, bugs start to show on realistic things. As ab example you can use the STEP file from an archive I uploaded earlier in this topic:http://salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/717851952/982245955/Geometry-2.zipOr, as alternative, take a cylinder, bind it to a cube with a side length equal to a cylinder's diameter (you may take the side length a bit larger to give a harder work to mesher), then bind this to a cube with significantly larger or smaller size (we have the SolidWorks license so I can simply create one or couple of test geometries for you, if you want). As a result you will create steps. Then use the NetGen in Salome andenable cell size limit by curvature. It's important because with this feature on you'll get small cells at the corners and, possibly, layers bugs (please notice bug placement on my picture). You can't avoid these small cells with surface sizing because the NetGen will ignore it respecting curvature and you can't disable curvature option because the resulting mesh will be too coarse on small features like, for example, noise killers in a chimney, and, you know, we shouldn't use such meshes in engineering to avoid errors in velocity field around noise killers. Then try to apply layers to all faces except one side of cylinder (assuming there is an inlet) and one side of the second cube (outlet).If you will use my geometry, please check the variant with layers only on diffusor part, but not on cone and cube-like part. This will create a difficulty for the layers algorythm because it will have to limit layers on a surface oriented to layered face at the angle far from 90*. You may also try the case where all faces except inlet and outlet (you will find the picture in the archive, layeres faces colored in pink and annotations are given). IMHO, using my geometry from archive is preferred because it doesn'd require any drawing and layers bugs are very likely to appear on this geometry (please don't forget to enable curvature size limit to make mesher's settings realistic).Thanks for you attention and help!",

Some steps are small, Salome will create corresponding small elements there so there wiil be a challange for the layers algorythm that should reduce layers thickness in that area but not in other places where tetra elements are relatively big so the final layer thickness must also be big to provide correct size ratio of prisms and adjacent tetras.To be continued for more attachments...",

As a result, there is no thickness limitation despite of very small tetras in some layered regions, so there is no problem with prism/tetra size ratio in Ansys mesher. Please see the attachment for example of layer thichness reduction in Ansys (it's from Geometry-2.zip, reposted here for your convinience).",

In Ansys mesher, if the face marked for inflation contacts with another face that shouldn't be \"layered\" the behaviour of the mesher depends from the angle between faces. If the angle is about 90*, layers are terminated on the adjacent face (that is considered boundary). If the angle is 180* or more, the number (but not thickness) of layers is gradually reduced and no \"negative-volumed\" elements are created, mesh is correct. I attached the picture of Ansys mesh cross-section in region that was problematic for Salome layers algorythm. As you can see, the number of layers is gradually reduced, no any bugs are created. I don't show the upper side, there are only triangle mesh faces.Thanks for your attention. Hope there will be improvements for layers in Salome in next versions.

Then how I see in other posts, to create the cellZones I generate a new group but insted of a group under the face selection, I selected volume in the group creation window. But it only let me to select the all volume, no the part that I want to get with rotation, the propeller.4. I generated the mesh with no problem at all, but I was conscius about that the cellzone generated was the all volume, no the propeller.Can you help me with this?The first thing to note is that my mesh is very coarse, just trying to figure my problem.Thanks to all!",

This might be a stupid question but does anybody know if it is possible to visualize the direction of the principal stresses in Salome? Just in case, I'm not referring to the component stresses (Sig-XX, Sig-YY, Tau-XY) but the principal stress in the 'traditional' meaning (P1/P2).If not possible 'out-of-the-box' maybe I'm so lucky that someone has made a script to do this.Thanks.Kind regardsJoern V.

                "Jean Pierre,Thanks for your reply.I believe the vector components are also stored on the MED-file. The reason I posted this question was that when trying to visualize the principal stress vector (as glyphs) they did not point in the correct direction. I have done some simple tests and believe the reason for this is that Code Aster stores the vector components (X,Y,Z) in the element local axis system (to be confirmed) whereas Salome interprets them as being in the global axis system.I further believe that a possible workaround it to use vector transformation since the vectors for the element local axes are also stored on the MED-file. Hopefully I will have time to check this soon and will post a follow-up on this thread.In the mean time, I appreciate any comment/suggestion regarding my assumptions above.Best regardsJoern V.

                "The coordinates of the principal stress vector are stored as components of SIEQ_ELGA. For PRIN_1 for instance, they are named VEC_1_X, VEC_1_Y, VEC_1_Z (see the documentation of operator CALC_ELEM). These vectors are normed, so you have to apply a factor to see both the direction and the magnitude of the principal stress. And as Jean-Pierre said, in Paravis or in Post-pro, only the first 3 components are taken into account to build a glyph. So the solution is to use the filter Calculator to create a new field based on SIEQ_ELGA, with the 3 components of the vector. To do so in Paravis:- click on the Calculator icon (or in the menu Filters> Common)- give a name to the new field, for instance PRIN_1_vector- at the bottom of the table, in the drop-down menu Scalars, you can select a component of your fields.

If I want to mesh the geometry I'm always getting the error message «memory allocation problem» even with a coarse mesh. But I think it's not a question of memory allocation. An error inside the model (or inside Salomé) will cause the program to run out of memory. Why I do think so? Please read:Trial 1: Meshing typeNo matter which meshing algorithm I use - always the same error. I think I tried all combinations 3D-2D-1D...Trial 2: Importing the geometryYesterday I got the chance to model the identical geometry in Unigraphics, concerted it to a STEP file and imported it in Salomé. Meshing works well with tetrahedral mesh. Even with a very coarse and a very fine mesh. As I will not have access to Unigraphics in general, this way is no solution.Trial 3: Repairing the modelI tried to «Glue» or «Sew» the Salomé model: The error remains.Trial 4: Dividing the modelIf I divide the model into two parts and mesh first one part and then the second part meshing works well. But how to make one mesh out of it for the calculation in Aster? Aster is asking for the main shape. If fill in the whole model, Aster wants to build a new mesh and I have the same problems as shown above.May I have your help, please?Do you have any idea about the meshing problem?How to combine two meshes in one calculation?

As per the instructions I assign a global \"Regular 1D\" algorithm to split the edges and \"3D Extrusion\" (which appears as \"Prism-3D\" in the tree structure). For a submesh I assign NETGEN 2D-1D algorithm to two opposing faces in order to create triangular surface elements.The problem seems to be that the two opposing faces are meshed separately and so their meshes are not identical.Please could you advise me how to fix this, or point me to an existing discussion.Thank youJohn",

I have tried this like so; the global mesh algorithm is NETGEN 1D-2D-3D, the middle cube has the 3D extrusion algorithm as a submesh, and a second submesh assigns tets to one of the faces (in fact I tried it without the second submesh, hoping that the global tet algorithm would do the same, but I got something similar to what you see below, but on both faces).As you can see, the central cube does not contain prisms. How do I correctly assign the submesh information to achieve this? Again, I could assign the submesh to two opposing faces but, as we saw, the meshing on the two faces would not be identical.Thank you for your time.Best wishesJohn",

There is no message saying that the two opposing faces have non-identical meshes! OK, onto the next stage...Now I have a model with more advanced shapes. (This is a simple test model so whether it is suitable for FEM is not an issue. It is just to get the meshing working).Here I have a sandwich of three solids of more complicated shape. This time the prisms are distorted somewhat.I used the same approach as with the cube sandwich but not the non-identical mesh error is back.Please could you advise me on what to do?Thank youJohn",
                "Thank you, I think we were writing our last posts at the same time; this time I tried the new model with 2D projection of one face to the other. This part seems to work but now there are errors and a very interesting results with the 3rd solid.I wonder if this is a problem that can be overcome?",

This now seems to work with no errors.I find it  disappointing that it is often necessary to find such workarounds in Salome. It is undoubtedly great software but I often find such stumbling blocks when developing a new model, and it leads me to doubt the robustness of the meshes that I am producing.  If you follow a logical approach, by extension of previous models, then finding such problems like the last one I mentioned should not happen.I also very often have SIGSEGV segmentation violation problems when working, which I assume is more of a GUI issue than backend.I am glad that I am not a developed on such a complicated piece of software, as it must be a nightmare sometimes.Have a great day!John",

I am used to deal with rather big meshes, and for me even 300,000 points at this step of the Netgen computation is high...Your mesh is simply to much fine... In 3D the number of cells increases very quickly! How many cells do you want?Best regards,William",
                "Hi William!I was trying to mesh for a DES case so I used a resolution of 300 Y+ for the surface meshing of the wing and 0.9 times the boundary layer thickness for the inner boundary of the refinement sphere. It is very fine I know, but I was trying to push the limits of Salome! =)What is the upper limit of the number of surface elemets for a reasonable time meshing with netgen?Meanwhile I will try to reduce the surface elements!Thanks for the support!RegardsDavid",
                "Actually, I don't know the maximum number of elements, but let's say your surface mesh on the wing has only 100,000 elements, so just one layer of volume cells touching your wing will contain also 100,000 elements.know let's say the number of cells separating your wall and the external boundary of your refinement area is 100, so you will have at very least 100 x 100,000 = 10 million cells in your refinement area ! Without considering the viscous layer! And without considering mesh outside the refinement area!From my experience, with a good computer (3.60 GHz, 64 bits), a mesh having more than 20 million cells begins to take time to be generated in Salome. Maybe few hours.But it is true that I have never made DES and to do such thing, you need indeed a fine mesh...So, there is no magical solution, excepted trying to reduce both domain size and increase element size...But inevitably it will take lots of time to be generated. Maybe several days.(I hope you have also such a super computer to solve such very huge mesh)Best regards,William",

            "discussion": [
                "I'm running a script in terminal mode with Salome 6.4.0 on windows 7 (64 bit). Salome pops up a terminal window where the script is executed, but, at the end of the script, the window does not close, and I have to do it manually (which is not very batch-like). Is there some command line option or python command to close the terminal at the end of the script? It would be great if I could also pass an exit code (e.g. 0 or 1) at the end of the script -- but shutting down the terminal is much more pressing.I'm running the script as follows:run_salome.bat -t MyScript.py MyParam1 MyParam2I've tried adding -b and/or -u to the command line, but the effect was the same. I've also tried --shutdown-servers=1, but I got an error message saying that --shutdown-servers is not a recognized command line option.Any help are appreciated.",

                "I've had a bit of success by changing the line:START runSalome %*from run_salome.bat to:runSalome %*At this point, there's no new terminal popping up, and the script is executed in the same terminal. However, the script is still executed in the background (it returns immediately to the shell prompt, while continuing the execution in the background). This still means that I don't know when the script finished execution. Furthermore, all the process launched by Salome are still running in the background (e.g. SALOME_LauncherServer.exe); these are not reused, so running Salome again spawns them anew.Is there a python command that shuts down all the server processes?As for figuring out when the script is done, a very ugly solution would be:a) At the end of each script, add some code to write a short file called \"Done\" in a certain location              andb) Write a program that starts the modified run_salome.bat, and then simply waits until that \"Done\" file is present on the disk. Then simply return to the terminal (perhaps after trying to kill all the SALOME... processes).I'm still hoping there's a simpler solution to all this, maybe something that's already implemented.",

Indeed, if I create a study and save it (see the one attached for example, which contains basic geometries from Salome : Box_1, Cylinder_1...), then close Salome GUI and reopen it, open my saved study, and try to get an object in doing : Box = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/Box_1\"), Box is NoneType.Then, if I load GEOM module (in clicking on the button in GUI), the code above works, I get my Box.So, my question is : is there a way to make it work without loading the GEOM module in GUI? It could be useful for example when working in TUI (open a study and then get back geometries in python variables).I have the same trouble doing Exercise 11 (as in the post :http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/201392457#344200609).Thank you.Best regards,Megane",
                "Hello Megane,Result of salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath() function is actually not a typed data object - it is an identifier of the data in the study (so-called \"SObject\"). To get a data object itself, you need to invoke GetObject() function from the result.I.e. in case of GEOM module:import GEOMBoxSO = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/Box_1\")Box = BoxSO.GetObject()Last two lines can be subsituted by a single one:Box = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/Box_1\").GetObject()Note, however, that if the SObject is not found (e.g. if path is invalid or data is not loaded yet), you'll get an exception. Notice \"import GEOM\" line - it is substantial; without it you will obtain not GEOM::GEOM_Object, but generic CORBA::Object instead.Further, your use case is even more tricky. When the study is loaded from the file (in a pure SALOME session), the module data (GEOM, in your case) is not loaded yet. If you use ony TUI, you must do it manually in a script. This can be done, for instance, with the following piece of code:import GEOMfrom salome.geom import geomBuildergeompy = geomBuilder.New(salome.myStudy)studyBuilder = salome.myStudy.NewBuilder()studyBuilder.LoadWith(salome.myStudy.FindComponent(\"GEOM\"), geompy)Box = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath(\"/Geometry/Box_1\").GetObject()Regards,Vadim",
                "Hi Vadim,Thank you for your explanations. I try your solution ; it's better but I still got issues. Here is a simple example.Let's say we keep the same saved study than before (ie :Study1.hdffrom my previous post) which containsBox_1. The script attached here (test_findgeom.py) initializes Salome, imports GEOM, geomy, loads the GEOM module as you said, then try to get backBox_1withFindObjectByPath, and to get back all Geom Objects of the study.Now, to test it, I have 2 different ways (files are in the same directory than runAppli):-./runAppli Study1.hdf test_findgeom.pywhich opens the study in GUI and launch py python script : it works!-./runAppli -t Study1.hdf test_findgeom.pywhich launches Salome without GUI (in terminal mode) : it does not work. In fact, it is as if it does not \"see\"Study1.hdfand does not load it (I can replace Study1.hdf with anything, it would produce the same result).If I try to open my study directly in test_findgeom.py (see commented lines in it), and launch it with :-./runAppli -t test_findgeom.pyI get the following error message : \"[...] There is already an active study in this session [...]\".So do you know what am I doing wrong?Thank you again!Regards,Megane",
                "Hello Megane,Yes, indeed, in SALOME 7.4.0 and before, runSalome -t <study> did not work (here, <study> is a path to HDF file). This was a bug, actually.In SALOME 7.5.0 (that is to be released very soon) this bug is fixed, so your script will work (I tested it, and it is OK).To make it working with previous versions of SALOME, you need to open a target study in the Python script, e.g.:salome.setCurrentStudy(salome.myStudyManager.Open(\"/home/F32670/salome/Study1.hdf\"))Also, as since version 7.4.0 SALOME is a single-study application, you have to close study previously opened by salome.salome_init(). Thus, finally, this should look like follows:import salomesalome.salome_init()salome.myStudyManager.Close(salome.myStudy)salome.setCurrentStudy(salome.myStudyManager.Open(\"/home/F32670/salome/Study1.hdf\"))This is not quite simple and looks like a workaround, but it worksRegards,Vadim.",

                "Hello everyone,For a project that I'm doing, I'm trying to mesh a vehicle geometry in SALOME that is to be used for a number of thermal simulations. These simulations require me to define the appropriate boundary conditions and materials for each surface and as there are quite a number of different BC's/materials (about 187 different groups of elements, ~3000 faces total), I'm trying to make this automated using a python-script.So far, I've imported the geometry, exploded it to compounds (which matches the file structure/names in the STEP file), and partitioned it again. The latter is required as the nodes of the mesh have to be coincident for my simulations.Now, I'm trying to generate groups in the partitioned vehicle based on the compounds of the original exploded geometry. To do this, I'm using GetInPlace as suggested in multiple posts on this forum (see the attached .py file for more details):geompy.GetInPlace(theShapeWhere,theShapeWhat,True,theName=\"name\")However, GetInPlace does not yield the desired groups: instead of just returning a group with elements corresponding to the compound in the original geometry, the group also contains nearby faces that are connected to the compound (will attach a image of this in a next post).I've tried changing the boolean from True to False, but the results just got worse (more additional faces connected) and GetInPlaceByHistory returns the same results. Furthermore, limiting the tolerance before partitioning the main shape doesn't work either, nor does turning on/off the unit scaling during the import of the STEP file.Doing it manually (using the GUI) will result in the creation of the proper groups, so I know it should be possible.Any help regarding this topic would be greatly appreciated. Doing it all by hand is quite cumbersome, especially as the model will have some design iterations.Best regards,Marc",

I hope you understand.Thanks.Marc",

            "discussion": [
                "Dear all,a new story into my endeavours with SMESH and HOMARD:I have a mesh containing some pyramids (inside of wall-prisms) like the ones in the image attached. I saw two possibilities of avoiding trouble with HOMARD:1.) Use a function of SMESH called \"Cut into tetraheders\" with a group consisting of all pyramids in the mesh. This function does take time, but it works within SMESH. Unfortunately in my case this produces a mesh which at least in OpenFOAM's checkMesh does fail several of the critical tests (holes in the boundaries, etc.). No need for refining with HOMARD, then.2.) As mesh refinement would not be necessary too close to the pyramids, why not use the \"Authorized Pyramids\" function from within HOMARD? If I understood correctly, this should leave the pyramids as they were - they would not have to be touched anyway. Nevertheless, the result still is one of a failing HOMARD computation, stating something of a mistake before conversion with this refinement. Several subroutines (p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }UTAURQ, VCMACO, VCMAIL, AVCONV) all fail with error code 2.To me that looks like the Authorized Pyramids-function would not work. What could I do to make it work?Or am I missing another problem?Thank you again in advance for pointing out how I could solve the problem!Cheers,Bernhard",
                "Hello,I give a focus about HOMARD and the pyramids. HOMARD doesn't refine pyramids, at any time. You may deal with pyramids in two situations.Firstly, to make the transition between refined zone and not refined zone with hexaedral or prismatic elements, a special refinement is used. This refinement produces tetrahedra and/or pyramids. Those pyramids are produced as an output. But at the next iteration they are not refined, due to the properties of the algorithm. (seehttp://doi:10.1016/j.finel.2012.11.008)Secondly, if the initial mesh contains some pyramids, the situation is different. If nothing is done the conversion of this initial mesh is rejected. If you consider that the refinement will never reach thes pyramid, they can be included with the advanced option \"Authorized pyramid\" : they are read, but ignored during the algorithm, and produced as an output as they were at the begining, provided that none of their edges is cuthttp://docs.salome-platform.org/salome_7_3_0/gui/HOMARD/en/intro.html?highlight=pyramidsIf I undestand your message, you do use the second solution with the advanced option and it fails. Could you send the log file of HOMARD?Last, I don't undestand your first point:  \"Cut into tetraheders\"WAs the final mesh uncorrect? What do you mpean with \"No need for refining with HOMARD, then.\"?RegardsGérald NICOLAS",
                "Dear Gerald,after some discussions with a colleague I still agree that it is a wise choice not to touch pyramids during refinement. So I agree with the HOMARD-approach. Leave them be and they will not hurt you (too much).Short answer: You understood completely well!1.) I ticked the box in the advanced options and tried so several times. The output (see attached log-file) unfortunately was the same every time and I GUESS/THINK (with some certaincy) it has to do with the pyramid treatment.2.) Exactly what you think: I checked the cut but unrefined mesh within OpenFoam's checkMesh and it already produced errors. Thus it would have been needless to spend even few seconds on \"Homarding\" that mesh.This problem I solved for the moment by producing an initial mesh without pyramids - which means prisms instead of hexaeders at the walls, unfortunately. Thus I still would prefer if the optional pyramid ignorance would work for me...Cheers,Bernhard",
                "Thanks Bernhard.I am very surprised with the discrete boundary that is included into the log file. It looks as if it was the same mesh as the mesh for the calculation: all the numbers are identical. In fact, a mesh for a discrete boundary is only used when the boundary of the domain is a curve. (seehttp://docs.salome-platform.org/salome_7_3_0/gui/HOMARD/en/gui_create_case.html?highlight=boundary#the-boundaries)In your case, I guess that the problem comes from the conversion of this mesh because HOMARD is expecting only 1D elements.Could you give me more information about this boundary? Why do you have it into the configuration?Gérald",
                "Dear Gerald,after having problems with the first try, I did different runs with different settings and one of them included marking the setting for discrete boundaries. Seems I just sent you the log of this case. In all cases the error message itself was the same, so I did not consider that to be of major interest.I will provide you with another log shortly, with the only option changed from the defaults being the authorized pyramids.Cheers,Bernhard",
                "And here it is: The latest runlog of Homard on that mesh.The only change from the defaults were- advanced option: Check the authorized pyramids- the zone of refinement to be only a part of the mesh - in which I am quite certain that there are no pyramids.Just a short side-remark: The \"Print\"-button for the log seems not to be implemented...",
                "I checked the function. You are right: the option is not taken into account when it is selected through the GUI. Bug. But it is fine when HOMARD is driven by a python file, through the TUI. So I suggest that you launch the creation of the case with a python file:filename = os.path.join(WORKINGDIR, \"maill.00.med\")Case_1 = homard.CreateCase(\"Case_1\", \"Mesh_Box_1\", filename)dirname = os.path.join(WORKINGDIR, \"resu\")Case_1.SetDirName(dirname)Case_1.SetConfType(1)Case_1.SetPyram(1)The function SetPyram authorizes the pyramids. You can see it when editing the case in the GUI. Then compute.I am so sorry. I will correct this bug in the new release of SALOME.Gérald",
                "Gerald,there is no need to be sorry! As I wrote: I already have an acceptable solution of the problem by the changed mesh. Your solution makes it nearly perfect, and as soon as it is implemented it will be as perfect as it can get (except maybe for the case where pyramids are refinable).Anyhow, I definitely will make use of this functionality when starting my mesh studies sometime later this week.I guess the \"typical\" user would use the software via TUI, but I was in need of a rather quick approach, and GUIs are quicker to be mastered than TUIs, in my experience. That is the choice everyone has to make when going for an interface: Be on the control-side or on the goodlooking one.Okay, so the lines you provide above are the part for setting up the basic case, correct? Putting them into a short script and loading that script will do the step between activating HOMARD and making the setup for the iteration?Once again: Thank you for that precious software and your answers in this forum!Cheers,Bernhard"

I'd like to have a mesh similar the mentioned example, with as many hexa as possible, in the whole 'central' volume.Or maybe I didn't understand your explanations, Robert, and I'm sorry.Thanks for your patience.",

Then I applied the3D extrusionalgorithm (Prism_3D), theQuadrangle_2DandRegular_1Dto the whole mesh.Are there better ways to obtain this? I'm enough satisfied with the resulting mesh but I'd like to improve it and slightly modify the 2D mesh on the rounded faces: how can I use the Netgen 1D-2D in order tooptimize and build as many quadrangles as possible?

I can't remember peak memory usage but the current 128GB of RAM was sufficient to complete the meshing. At a guess, the meshing operation may have used around 50-60GB of memory at peak.You have a couple of options as i see it:1. Contact DISTENE for a commercial licence, they offer a trial - perhaps they might offer a low-cost licence to Salome users for personal/academic use - (how about it Distene?)2.

I want a mixed mesh, with a hex mesh as large as possible becouse I need to lower computation time. Maybe the inner shape is not so complex to require a tet mesh, but it's just a preliminary study and shapes will become more complex, so I need to find out a general procedure. My troubles involve the matching of the two grids. I used a typical[hexa_3D - quadrangle_2D - regular_1D]algorithm for the outside box and applied a [tetrahedron (Netgen) - Netgen 2D/Length from edges/Quadrangle preference]to the inner box (with a Max Size 1D too). I also tried with[tetrahedron (Netgen) - Netgen  1D-2D/Fine/Max Sixe/Allow quadrangles/Optimize]. I preferNetgen 2DbecouseNetgen 1D-2Drefines the mesh just around curves and so on, but I need to control cells size in other regions too (I'm not so expert and don't know alternatives).

To extract the surfaces I needed I used the boolean operation common. The problem now is that the surface of one of the five volumes is not created. The plane is big enough to intersect all volumes.I found that the volume which is not processed has the separation line of the round surfaces not just in one direction. May be this is not handled correct within the common operation.I attached the dump file and the step file because the hdf file is larger than 100 kB. With this files the problem can be reproduced.Thank you for your support and efforts.Best regards,Urs",

                "Hi all,I just noticed that the default behavior when importing a MED file in ParaVis changed, and from V7.4.0 all \"blocks\" are merged into one, and thus not available in the viewer. Exporting to multiblock VTK only leaves one block available.In the release notes of V7.4.0 there is a small general notice that:\"New implementation of MedReader has some major differences from the previous version that might require porting of related scripts.\"Is there any work-around to enable again the exporting of a multi-block VTK from an imported MED file?Best,Richard",

                "Hello Richard,Yes indeed MEDReader has been totally rewritten after 7.4.0 for 3 main reasons:- performance (when lots of groups/fams)- a clear display of MED file data (fields / meshes / groups)- avoid visualisation aretefacts for field on nodes links to multi blocksQuestion: Why new MEDReader generates a multi block dataset with one block ?It's due to ParaView limitation. It is not possible for a Reader in ParaView to dynamically set type of DataSet. As a MED file can contain several type of meshes (cartesian, unstructured, cuvelinear) it's not possible to tell ParaView statically which type of DataSet it will be.It explains why MultiBlock is the output of new MEDReader. To have a clear representation a single block is in the output MultiBlock. Why ? Imagine you have a mesh M and a field F lying only on a part of M inside M. With old MEDReader output you can't see you field F. You have to extract blocks to see your field.But if you are a fan of multi blocks you can easily use several \"Extract Groups\" and/or \"Extract Cell Type\" instances and put the results of them into a multi block using \"Merge Block\" filter.Best regards,Anthony",

I'm not really a fan of those multiblock files, but our workflow currently relies on them, so I need to find a workaround.You solution with the \"extract Groups\"+\"Merge Blocks\" filter sound interesting. I quickly tried it, but it looks like I can not use multiple inputs for the \"Merge Blocks\" filter (with Salome7.8).Do you have a code example that you could share, or an idea what I might do wrong here?Best,Richard",

The mesh support for all fields is identical.The files can be found here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nFQbXivoi1a0tBNUowc3RJVzA/view?usp=sharingas already shared on a related topic:http://salome-platform.org/forum/forum_10/71657686Best,Richard",

In the attached study dump, there is a box and a plane (as 3D object) intersecting the box. What I want as \"cut\" is the part of the plane which is common with the box, which is a quadrangular area in this case. If the plane was tilted, the \"cut\" would become triangular. If I replaced the box by a sphere, I would want to get a circular area as result, etc.I hope I could make clear what I mean...Now to achieve that, I can indeed do what you propose above, i.e. make a partition and extract the corresponding face.But still I think this must be a boolean operation, so I have continued to experiment. If I do Operations > Boolean > Section, I just get the edges of the intersection face. But selecting both the box and the plane and doing Operations > Boolean > Common gives me the face I want.

I meshed it correctly. The rebar uses RadialQuadrangle1D2D algorithm. (See attached file test_1.py)However, when a I tried to model another test setup (adapting the precious script) where the coil is the only different element (I only reorient the mortar box and rebar cylinder / See attached file test_2.py), I obtain the following error when meshing the rebar:Algorithm: RadialQuadrangle1D2DSub-shape: #278(Face)Error: The face must be a full circle or a part of circle (i.e. the number of edges is less or equal to 3 an one of them is a circle curveI am currently using salome 7.3, the one that was shipped with code aster (salome-meca). I know it is old, but it works smoothly for my occasional needs. I have also tried with salome 9, but I get the same error.

                "Hello Salome users and developers,I'm building a fully parametric model in Salomé, and I would like to be able to group a number of faces into boundaries for meshing and later exporting for CFD analysis using OpenFOAM.I have created a simple geometry, grouped faces into 'inlet', 'outlet', and 'wall' groups in the Geometry module. However, I notice that if I change some parameters of my geometry that drastically changes the shape (all of sudden there are overlapping walls as opposed to not touching), the face numbering changes. This then messes up the face numbering I use to group geometric faces.I know you can use filters in the Mesh module to combine faces into groups, but I'm wondering if it's possible to use a co-planar filter in the Geometry module to combine faces. I would like to be able to take advantage of the fact that if I start by building a 6 sided box (with faces 1-6), I could just select all faces that are co-planar with Face_1 and group them as 'inlet' rather than have to hope that I didn't make too many changes in my geometry.Is this possible?Looking forward to your ideas and comments.Chris",

I have successfully created groups with the name wall corresponding to the parts I showed you earlier, but now I have a group called \"wall\" for each loop of the iteration; they are not combined into one larger 'wall' group.Can you tell me what I need to do so that I can just have one group called wall that contains all of the faces I collect in the \"faces\" list?It's possible I'm not explaining myself very well, allow me try to rephrase what I'm trying to do. I am attempting to mesh the inside of a box which contains some non-primitive features. The precise location and number of faces of those parts will change on during an optimization routine due to geometry parameterization. I am also partitioning the geometry for hybrid meshing as well, so the geometries will be sliced up, that's why I am trying to group the resulting partitioned faces.I am trying to group all of the faces of my geometry into very basic groups (inlet, outlet, innerWall and outerWall) so that I can group the boundary mesh faces into patches after meshing. That's why I thought starting at the basic shapes (Box_1 and Cylinder_1) would make creating the groups later on easier.I have not been able to use your advice to accomplish these goals, and I'm not sure what you mean by:\"You can do anything you need with the found sub-shapes\".I hope this isn't too much to ask. The documentation is great, but not clear enough for me. I'm specifically looking atthis page, but in that example the author creates a new group in the main part in every loop, whereas I want to combine all the faces in face_list that lie on my partitioned geometry into one group.Please see python dump attached",

A conformal hexahedral mesh, in the very case, seems to be impossible to be created.As I know, with Fluent and Gambit, one can joint two non-conformal hexahedral meshes and the junction(s) is(are) automatically built.

The eccentricity (which is equal to the distance between their axis) is 70.* The inlet surface is on CYL1 and the outlet of the whole system is on CYL3.* The fluid enters the injector via inlet (so CYL1) then through CYL2 and finally CYL3. It exists the system via outlet (so CYL3).* All surfaces that envelop the system are defined as walls.

                "Dear all,I am trying to create a mesh for an external flow around a motorcycle rider. The problem I have is that the rider itself is a solid created by different faces patched together and so when I cut the rider out of the domain I get that the domain-rider boundary created by the cutting operation is created by more than one face as well. Problems arise when I try to mesh the domain, since every face is meshed on its own (with a conformal mesh on the internal edges) and this causes the mesh to get really fine in some spots (namely, where the faces join with one getting smaller and smaller). The problem gets even worse if I don't set a minimum cell size when I build the mesh. See the attached script to understand what I mean.I understand the problem is that the faces kept the internal edges when I merged them, but I was not able to remove them.So my questions are:1) how can I build a single a face without internal edges from a list of faces?2) if I cannot do that, can you suggest a way to build at least the helmet (take a look at the geometry created in my script, you'll recognize it) with just one face? At the moment, I am using MakeFilling to build faces from a set of wires, but if I don't divide the helmet face into two parts MakeFilling does not work properly (it builds a concave face instead of a convex one)3) if this cannot be made, can I tell salome to ignore some edges when meshing a compound face?4) if none of the above can be done, do you have any suggestions?Thank you so much for your time!Mattia",

If on the other hand min size is too big, the mesh computration fails (it does not crash, it just keeps on working and I have to cancel it to stop it, presumably because it cannot mesh the thin parts of the faces. Maybe it just takes a long time, I never waited to see if it ends or crashes, since even if it managed to compute the mesh it would still take much too long).There is another problem too, and it is that even if I manage to get the right value for min size, the mesh still gets refined in those areas where the faces get thin and I get a mesh with refined spots in the middle of what is (in my head) supposed to be a single face instead of a \"regular\" mesh.I am attaching to this post (and to the following) three images to show what I mean (I cannot attach them all in one post, since I cannot compress them under 100 kb).If there is anything that I left still unclear, please feel free to askThanks again,Mattia",

                "Hello Gilles,Thanks for solving the problem.  I am trying to understand what I was doing incorrectly.  Would you kindly take a moment to explain?  Your explanation would be very useful for the Weekly Puzzle #1 discussions on the CodeAster SalomeMeca forum, where the attribution will be made to you.  Thank you.Regards, JMB.",
                "Hello JMB,I think that as a member of the SALOME developer's team, I should not be allowed to participate too the Weekly PuzzleIt would be too easy for usYou will take the credit for this puzzle, since you were very close to the end.To explain the script:What you did:First the geometry was partitioned in order to get a compound of blocks. Then the hexa mesh was defined with 1D, 2D and 3D algos. Actually, the definition of the 2D and 3D  are pretty straight forward. The 1D is a commonly used \"Number of segments\" algo.What you tried to do:The idea was to define a submesh on a radial edge. The radial edge had to be extracted from the main shape with SubShapeAllSorted function. This functions returns the list of sub shapes of given type, here edges. To get the radial edge, there are 2 methods:1. Explode the main shape in the GUI, identify the radial edge by renaming it, and dump the study to localize the radial in the returned list of edges.2. In TUI only, identify the radial edge by using a function in the family of the GetShapesOnXXX(). For example by using a box:box = geompy.MakeBoxDXDYDZ(1,20,2)geompy.TranslateDXDYDZ(box,0,5,-1)[RadialEdge] = geompy.GetShapesOnBox(box,Bushing, geompy.ShapeType[\"EDGE\"], GEOM.ST_ONIN)The 2nd method is more generic and is sometimes the only one possible when the geometry is  very complicated.Once the radial edge is found, a 1D sub-mesh can be defined on it, with the required number of segments:radialMesh = BushingMesh.Segment(geom=RadialEdge)radialMesh.NumberOfSegments(Radial_Mesh_Density)Finally the propagation hypothesis is very important: the mesh behaves as if we had defined the same submeshes on all the other radial edges. One single line avoids to write 7 submeshesThat's it.Best regards,Gilles",

As other said in this forum, these cells are necessary to make transition between hexahedral cells (e.g. in prismatic layers around walls for vicious flow study), and tetrahedral layers (e.g. the domain out of prismatic layers).Some people in this forum said that they had problem exporting pyramids in UNV format, so I deduce that it is possible to create pyramids in Salome. But I tried everything I could and I wasn't able to do it.For example:1) I created a simple box.2) I created a mesh on this box without 3D algorithms to begin with, but I applied on it a 1D \"Wire discretisation\"  algorithm and a 2D \"Netgen 2D\" algorithm.4) Then, I applied on a face of the box a sub-mesh on which I applied a 2D \"Quadrangle (Mapping)\" algorithm.A screenshot of the result is here:http://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/722156pyramidBoxClip.pngA screenshot of my study tree is available here:http://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/362394pyramidBoxTree.pngA dump of the study is attached to this post.5) Then, I tried to find a 3D algorithm to fill the box with tetrahedralandpyramid cells.
