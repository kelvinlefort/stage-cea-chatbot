When they work, they are way powerful, but ever time I install them, my heart thumps, and not in a good way. As immeasurable as the gift and opportunity to be able to use this software, the preparation of installation of them is usually an event the crosses the line from challenging to traumatic.Does Salome really work on Debian Squeeze?

                "But nothing suspicious in the output.Probably this is a problem specific for Windows 8. In fact, SALOME was not qualified on Windows 8.I'll try to launch SALOME 7.6.0 on Windows 8 to see if I can reproduce this problem.",

                "Nothing, sorry. On my side, SALOME 7.6.0 is well running on Windows 8.In addition to already mentioned possible reasons while SALOME cannot be running, there's another known issue imposed by the Windows architecture.In short, on Windows search order for shared libraries is implemented as follows:* The directory where program is situated;* Windows system directory;* PATH env variable.This is quite different to Linux where LD_LIBRARY_PATH has top-most priority.SALOME consists of very large set of libraries, including third-party products. These libraries are distributed between different directories (in fact, each product and SALOME module is installed into separate directory). Search path for libraries is set in the launching script via setting environment variables, in particular, PATH on Windows (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux). I think you already see the possible problem on Windows - if some product being used by SALOME is also present on the workstation (e.g. it is installed with some other application) and libraries are installed into Window's system directory - you might get undefined symbols or other similar problem preventing correct SALOME work, due to incompatibility of product's version installed into system directory and coming with SALOME.Note that this is just a possible trouble, I don't guarantee it is your case. Actually this case is quite rare. It is, unfortunately, not easy to diagnose this problem. I hoped something could be printed into output log but did not see anything suspicious. Further analysis would require installing, for instance, Microsoft Dependency Walker and analyzing dependency of the libraries, etc.",
                "yeah I already thought about the dependency walker but assumed it would not be of much help as it usually shows things the executable needs when starting up. I could give it a try tough.",

I guess this is due to the very long time needed for the launch. Is there a timer somewhere that can be changed?Any hints welcome,Konyaro",

You can do this by editing salome launcher script (in the root directory), and add these variables, for example:context.setVariable(r\"CSF_RepeatServerRequest\", \"1000\")context.setVariable(r\"CSF_DelayServerRequest\", \"100000\")Even first of these two variables might be enough to solve the problem with time limits.However, it is worth to mention that since nothing significant has been changed in the SALOME launching procedure between versions 9.4 and 9.5 (as well as between 9.5 and 9.6), the problem might be caused by some another reason.Regards,Vadim.",

For all of its faults, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution.What better way to reduce the frustrations that people have installing Salome and other engineering applications--than to set up a small apt server?I have this vision of Salome Code_aster Code_Saturn OpenCascade, Gmesh, and Paraview being available from apt/synaptic. Well,  Paraview, and so is Gmesh--so why not Salome?I would like to try Salome 5x on Linux, but from what I have read, I am not sure that it's possible to run it on Ubuntu 64--the single most popular 64 bit Linux distrobution. Does anyone else see anything wrong with that?Please help Linux Engineering applications get out of the ghetto, and into the mainstream.BTW, the new Salome interface looks much better.",
                "Hi Brenda,I Partially agree with you...I will explain the \"partially\"...  It is a fact that Ubuntu is nowadays the most popular Linux Distro....  It is a fact that most eng apps live in a ghetto... but let me make two simple questions...Do Engineering Applications Power users care about the popularity of a distro...?I speak but I use something similar to ( the core of ) Ubuntu, which is Debian, as well as CaeLinux ( a *buntu derivative ) , FreeBSD and Slackware...  and, although I use them all, I can tell you that on the same hardware, Engineering applications compiled from source over Slackware 64 bit  perform much faster than precompiled binaries from Debian, for example...Compiling apps from source allows me to select which brand of compiler to use, and fine tune the compiler/linker options to build really fast bitches... create optimized math libraries or use the ones  from Math kernel from Intel...gmsh, OpenFOAM, mbdyn, Code Aster, Syrthes can all be much faster if compiled from source than if you use the rather conservative options of the packagers....Now, for what matters... :  What do power users care about...?? Ease of installation or pure performance...?This can be a matter of intense debate, but IMHO, Engineering application users ( those that use them in Linux/Unix ) are not n00bs...i think that Salome Development Team would make a greater service to the engineering community making the build of Salome universal in whatever platform ( RHEL/CentOS/SL *Buntu/Debian Mandriva Slackware *BSD )  in terms of Gnu/Posix compliance....Once the building is a \"systematic\" procedure independent of the platform ( Shipping all the needed pre requirements in a source tarball ) I think that the packaging can be adressed as a minor issue...Just my opinion here...Alex",
                "Thanks for replying.Generally, newer Linux is better Linux.I've been using CAELinux 64, but it's based on 8.4 LTS, which is now 3 generations old. I really appreciated that everything is all ready to go--and 64 bit, BUT the Salome is 4x, and not 5x. Salome 5x, appears to be much more mature, than 4x---and CAELinux does not yet have it,  So, here I am asking for an Apt server : )There are quite a few hidden and odd depends for Linux engineering software, such as older versions of Python, and Fortran, so it would seem that an apt server would solve a lot of installation issues, and keep us non-programmers from pestering everyone with compiling issues. With that said, even a non-programmers such as myself can do things to help, such as graphic work, or even--pester people for an apt server, so that that one programmer who needs to see what Salome can do before they work on in--actually sees it, and is inspired to be part of your team.[I had planned to do a video tutorial for Salome-Mecha, but the old video recording apps didn't work as well as the new ones.]If the definition of a \"power user\" is that: you don't need a working desktop for daily computer chores, then I am not one, but I've not been a fan of having a separate distro for everything, and so I think that part of the perceived quality of a program is: that it works, and integrates with the operating system as part of solution. I feel that it is a deficit for an Open Source engineering application to not play well with most Linux distros, but this could change.",
                "Hi...In my opinion, a power user is not a person who would pass without a desktop...  it is someone who might go well enough with a Window manager though...It is a person that can do well without a bloated environment associated with KDE's and Gnomes, and may go for a XFCE...It is a person that may as well try to build/run all that RAM/CPU hogging apps ( Code Aster, Salome Platform, qtOctave, Scilab, BRLCAD, OpenFOAM, just to name a few of them... ) over something a snappy and fast as FluxBox... provided it supports all the needed resources to support these apps ( X Server, etc... )Immagine the window manager's equivalence of a Sr 71a Blackbird.... doesn't have to be eyecandy and bloated...... but it is desirable to be reliable, resource-efficient and fast as hell...... This is how I define \"power-user\"....Alex",
                "I think that without an apt server, it would take a part time to full-time employee to keep Salome, Code Aster, and Code Saturne current. Even with .debs, there are the dependency issues, and an apt server would solve all of that.I think someone has Salome built on Ubuntu 9.10 64, but I'm not sure, and then what about the rest. Sigh.[As bloated as even Gnome is: it almost nothing compared to the RAM used to mesh a complicated part. Ubuntu boots in 200mb; meshing a part took gigabytes. My friend uses FVWM for file management. As powerful as it may be, the designer in me cannot bear to look at it.]",
                "The main problem here is the lack of a good autotools usage in the source code. I have donwloaded it some days ago, and it's just a chunk of folders with modules, but it isn't clear(so far) to me how to integrate them all, and the building procedure isn't that clear as a good organized GNU Toolchain compliant package in which you just open the README and INSTALL files and know what to do.Generally it should be as simple as executing a configure script that checks for dependencies, and then make to start the compiling process. Then make install to copy the stuff to the standard directories. What I see in the code is a bit different XD.By the way, doesn't salome make public the access to the version control system? something like bazaar or git ?Greetings, Felipe.",
                "Hi Felipe,Well, compiling Salome is exactly as you say: configure, make and make install.There is just 2 steps to do before that:- source the prerequisite environment file (to set the pathes for OCC, Netgen, Med and maybe Hdf5 depending on platform)- For each module, run build_configure in the source directory to generate the configure file.But I said in another post, on recent platforms such as ubuntu 9.10, Salome 5.1.2 will not compile as is, it needs some patches. Hopefully all those patches are integrated in the next version which will be release by the end of the month.Thus when you will get 5.1.3 sources files, you will just run the above commands and you will have a nice Salome runningOf course you have to compile the modules in the good order to satisfy dependencies: KERNEL, GUI, GEOM, MED, SMESH, NETGENPLUGIN, VISU and YACS.Best regards,Gilles",
                "Hi David,Thank you very much for your answer. Good to know the correct module order. But I still have some comments related to the source code:1.

There's may be a trick I already don't know.4. Still don't understand why isn't there a global autotools environment to configure; make;make install all the stuff from just one location.5.

Normally we should install a lot of 3rd party libraries to compile SALOME. But the tricky thing is though I seems to have installed all of those libs, qt still fails. This is due to a really stupid reason - some inter-compiling files are generated in /SOURCE/qt. When you start a new compilation, either you use --clean_all or not, the inter-files will not be deleted and updated. They just locate in /SOURCE/qt, untouched by the sat tools, and then cause the errors, like 'pkg-config disabled globally'. The trick to avoid those errors is to prepare your qt source again!

                "Hello,I am interested in building Salome from sources on windows (or maybe on Linux, see below). More specifically I am interested in building Geometry and Mesh modules and all their dependencies.So far, I found the following things:- This thread, which seems to be somewhat outdated: \"Novices guide to install and build on Windows\" (https://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_9/972618250#814073846). The worst thing, is that it seems, that \"Salome SDK Archive\" is not available for newer versions (or am I missing something?).- I downloaded sources from \"Downloads\" sections of the website (salome-platform-src9.4.0.tar.gz). I guess, that the modules, which I am interested in are \"GEOM\" and \"SMESH\", but it seems to me, that the README files inside are relevant rather to Linux, than Windows. Besides, they are also not extremely detailed.So, here are the questions, which I could not easily answer myself. Maybe someone could help me with them:- Is there some \"master\" CMakeLists.txt, which is aimed to build the whole platform (or at least it's core parts)? I don't see any...- Is there some way to understand dependencies between modules. E.g. if I want to build SMESH, do I also need GEOM? KERNEL, something else? How do I know?- [WINDOWS]: does build on windows involve use of cygwin? Or Linux subsystem?- [WINDOWS]: Which toolset is used on windows? MSVS? Which version?- [WINDOWS]: Is there anywhere the archive of dependencies available for windows (similar to the one, I pointed to at the beginning of the post, but for the current version), so that one does not need to collect them all one by one, but just unpack the archive?I work mostly on Windows, so it would be more convenient for me to have a Windows-build, but if for example it involves use of cygwin (or just significantly more complicated, than on Linux), then I would switch to Linux.The background for my interest is following: I have a project, where I need to prepare some mesh for OpenFoam. From all the options I tried Salome looks to be the most promising. With simple small models everything just works very nicely. But the problem is, that the model I use has about 4000 faces. And the geometry is not absolutely clean (but I still think, the real issue is size). With the geometry of this complexity performance issues show up. Simple geometry operations (like e.g. grouping faces) take minutes to complete. But it is even worse with meshing. I tried to generate the mesh. I waited for over 1 day, but it did not complete.So I am interested in doing some profiling of the operations, which I need. And probably improving the performance, if I can manage. If it will be successful, I can probably even commit back the code, if anyone would be interested in this.Thank you in advance,Dmitrii.",

                "imho, the problem with ubuntu is that it is not stable enough, due to a too much frequent upgrade, to the tendency to include too much young software releases and finally to the tendency to drop out the support to \"old\" hardware too early.I'm a long term linux user, and my opinion is that Ubuntu is the worst choice to build a workstation, while I think it can be a good option to make an home pc.More, we can't ask to the Salome team to build an installer for each \"famous\" linux distribution: Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, RedHat, Gentoo, etc etc etc.Did you think to switch to one on the supported platform?

                "I am more interested than Salome reaching the greatest number of people more than some sense of fairness.If there are tested instructions for installing Salome on Debian Lenny, the current version, I will check it out. Still, I anticipate problems because even in this thread, the posts which explain to me that the installation is straightforward--also have caveats, and those instructions are non-linear.The use of acknowledgement of package managers may someday allow Salome to be upgraded independent of its dependencies, and that would seem like something working toward.The idea of installing software into my home folder/directory seems barbaric.",
                "Hello everybody,Please understand that SALOME (as a lot of other softwares/libraries) is developed by its users (CEA/EDF). We develop SALOMEfor us and our partners. InstallWizard is the solution we chose cause it correspond to our needs. (It is not totally true as we even not use it internally).Indeed, packaging (rpm or deb) is the standard installation way choose by distribution and it provide a lot of useful fonctionnality. If we want that SALOME is mostly adopted by user, packaging is the solution. However we develop SALOME to use it, not to spread it around the world. So the official point is the current one : InstallWizard. And I think that this solution is really better than that we can found in other soft (only sources).In the same way, packaging, in the way CEA use SALOME, is not a good solution.For example :- RPM/DEB need a root access to be installed and a most of CEA user don't have a root access on the computer.- RPM/DEB need a strong attention on evolution of prerequisites. What happen if the official package of a prerequisite is updated to a version not compatible with SALOME ? We have to patch SALOME and recreate all packages. And if we don't make it in time, there is lot of chance that a lot of people will post here saying that we don't do our job. Making package make us dependent of the evolution of distributions.Regarding this point, you can understand that CEA/EDF will not spend time and money in a install method he will not use. InstallWizard is maybe not the good solution, but it works.You want to use SALOME instead of manage its installation on our computer ? We want to develop SALOME and add it new functionality instead of working on its installation method. Packaging is the distribution work. Not the user or developer work.However, SALOME is a free software, your are free to create packaging or adapt SALOME to other distribution. And as Gilles said, there are persons that are currently working on : for my part I'm working on Fedora packaging, Andrea (who is not part of the development team) is working on the OpenSuse one, Erwan is working on a Windows version and other on a MacOs version. They are personal actions in which CEA/EDF/Open CASCADE don't take officially part. For my part, when I'm making Fedora packaging, I'm considering working for Fedora not for SALOME.To finish, we are not autistic. A lot of people developing on SALOME are aware that InstallWizard is not the standard way. We are (I am) ready to work on a packaging of SALOME, to help you into the contribution you can made or anything else.I'm totally understand your point and I mostly agree with you, but CEA/EDF (I think) have other problems than packaging.Matthieu.",
                "As far as the prerequisites are concerned, how would the users/installers of Salome be spared from the same problems the packagers would have?\"InstallWizard is maybe not the good solution, but it works.\"On which current operating systems do they work?1.) Even in this thread, no one stated the installers work for Debian Lenny; although the sources are stated to compile for Debian Lenny.2.)

(It is not totally true as we even not use it internally).\"If they were used and tested more often--they might work better.As far as Debian is concerned, apt-get and .debs are the the official software installation methods. Alternate installers, methods, and folder structures can be thought as either support--or as subversive. Take your pick.I know, I am a sarcastic bitch, but at the same time, it would seems possible that a line of communication and consideration could established to ensure that Salome's depends grow with it, and not away from it.For example: there may still a minor bug with the 3d meshers that Salome uses, it's just a minor thing related to the uncolored groups creating random extra groups. It's just a minor thing, but things like this vex beginners like me. Anyway imagine that it was fixed in the meshers. Would it be great to be able to just update your system(s) and have that updated?As you stated, your people offered the software source, and there it is, but I have to wonder why it was opened in the first place.You want people to help make it better don't you?They have to see it first.",
                "@BrendaI think we are just to be grateful to the Salome team to make give the package for free. Remeber that a commercial package that can make the same work of salome could cost 10.000 euro or more.The team is payed from CEA and EDF corporations to work for them, not for the community. The availabilty of the package for the community is just a collateral result of the project, not the main scope.If you are in troubles to install Salome on Ubuntu and you need to use it, my suggestion is to switch to another supported platform, as Mandriva (I'm using it and I'm really satisified).Best regards, Alessandro.",
                "@BrendaEMOn a personal point a view, I totally agree with you. InstallWizard (IW) is NOT a standard way of installing software. The BETTER way is packaging (deb, rpm or whatever). (And this is why I'm working on Fedora packaging).When I said that IW works, I mean that it works in the way it have been designed to. IW doesn't work in any context. In fact, if your use binary install of IW, it only copy binaries. It works most of the time but it could not. This is the same problem with packaging. Despite of there standard way, there just copy binaries into the right place. If binaries compiled on debian don't work on ubuntu, they will not work, whatever they are copied with IW or deb.Yes, CEA computers are managed by other people than user. And yes, user doesn't have root access. Of course, you could say \"they could ask to have SALOME installed\" but please see how we can use SALOME before say it :- EDF/CEA users have access to some internal release, fixing there bugs. It could be more than a release per week.- User use several version of SALOME (some user are still with 3.2.10). And some time, in the same time.How, with rpm or deb, do you manage the fact that we install several distribution on the same computer (adding the fact that several version of SALOME can ask for several version of prerequisite) ? With IW, you can install SALOME in the directory you want ($HOME)In the same way, IW is not the solution that we use every day. Recompile SALOME every week with IW will obviously not be the good solution. Scripts launching \"configure, make, make install\" are maybe more complex but also more flexible.After that, (but it's hot the subject of this discussion), I agree that CEA/EDF could be more \"open\" on contribution of other users. There is no 'official' way to push user contribution. (But, as far I know, there is no user contribution).If I (and a lot of others) agree with you, please understand that the position of CEA/EDF/OpenCascade is different from the position of people developing SALOME (even if they are part of C/E/O). C/E/O are firms or research center, there are not software editor. Developing SALOME cost money and money isn't free. Spending money in a project is normal. Opening this project is really good and (as it ) doesn't cost a lot to C/E/O. However spending money to help 'public users' is not so easy to understand (especially for C/E/O). Maybe C/E/O will fix a bug or add a feature they don't need into SALOME. But it will be a occasionally action and there is little chance that this point change.\"As you stated, your people offered the software source, and there it\nis, but I have to wonder why it was opened in the first place.\"That's a good question. I'm obviously not the good person to answer it, but I will try anyway :CEA/EDF/OpenCascade/Others decided to open SALOME to add 'long-standing' and 'accessibility assurance' to the project. SALOME is a project started by several firms (and C/E/O are the last of them), being open is probably the best way to work in this context. This was first a 'political' choice. The technical points, alas, haven't been seen. Since, lot of things change. Maybe (probably) we have to rethink about 'why open source ?' but it haven't been done.Best regards,Matthieu."

                "Hello,I'm quite a newbee in Linux, so please excuse me if my question seems ridiculous! I just installed the version 6.6.0 of Salome on Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit version in the \"universal binaries for linux\"). I face now problems to launch the application. When I type ./runAppli in my ~/salome/appli_V6_6_0 directory, it returns me,ImportError : No module named siteI saw that it could be related the the installation of python. As far i did nothing particular to install python, i don't know if i have to.Can somebody help me?",
                "Hello Corentin,As I always say about Ubuntu, I recommend to use the Install Wizard instead of the universal binaries (I have never been able to use the universal binaries on Ubuntu). Here are my advices:http://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_9/864795268#74288942And since you are \"newbee\", you maybe want to know also how to \"add\" the script I give \"to the $PATH\".Actually, the PATH (or $PATH) is a variable in which are stored all paths to the folder containing all the executable commands you use in a Linux terminal. So to \"put my script in the PATH\", you can either move this script file into a folder already existing in your PATH (eg. /usr/bin), or add to the PATH the folder in which is your script.Here are more explicit instructions, to follow after installing Salome using the install wizard and checking at the end that Salome works fine (clicking on the \"Launch Salome\" button in the install wizard) :1- Open a terminal. [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[T] should work.2- Type (you can use [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[V] to paste command lines from the clipboard to the terminal):gedit3- Paste in Gedit the script I gave in the above link.4- Save the file under the name \"salome\", then exit Gedit.5- Make your script executable by typing:chmod +x salome6- a) If you want to copy your script into an existing PATH folder, type:sudo mv salome /usr/bin/ # This will ask for your password.6- b) If you want to modify your path folder, I recommend to create a \"bin\" folder in your \"home\" folder. To do so, type:mkdir binmv salome bin/cp .bashrc .bashrc~ # This will create a backup of your .bashrc file which is read each time you open a terminalecho \"export PATH='$PATH:$HOME/bin'\" >> .bashrcAfter that, you can put all your following scripts into this bin folder, make them executable and use them in the terminal like any other terminal command.So, to launch Salome after that, you will have to open a terminal and type:salomeI hope these instructions will be usefull for you.Best regards,William",
                "Dear William,Thank you for your quick and very detailed answer. I'll follow your instructions and let you know if it works!Best regards,Corentin",

However I do get some error messages when starting Salome, I don't think they are related but I'll post them any way.

( aside from the line 28 and 31 errors).I did try to run the universal libraries under ubuntu 10.04 64 bit on another machine and did not experiece any lockups. So I think we can exclude any bug in Salome. If the problem is incompatibility with 11.04 or if it's hardware related I can't say. I run on a Asus U36S meaning Intels sandy bridge and optimus nvida graphics card. However I've made sure that the nvida card is disabled so it shouldn't be a problem.If you have any more things I can try I'm willing to but some time to it.Nicolas",

                "Good day,I would like to share some patches & instructions for building / running Salome 7.8 on Mac OS X (tested on El Capitan).  These requires Apple System Integrity Protection to be turned off, so use at your own risk.Links to patches / screenshot at bottom of the post (because of 100 kb limit in the forum).Notes:1. Salome makes extensive use of DYLD_* environment variables, in a manner which is not compatible with Apple System Integrity Protection (El Capitan & later) and this is not possible to easily fix/work around.  The only option is to disable it, more info here:https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.htmlhttp://www.imore.com/el-capitan-system-integrity-protection-helps-keep-malware-away2. Prerequisite SIP requires Python to be built as a framework for python.  However then cmake has some problems detecting the python framework outside standard paths (seehttps://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=14809) therefore the attached patches modify the Salome code to query the compiler flags from the python executable instead of the standard FindPackage usage.3. Qt 4.8.4 is not compatible with recent Mac OS X & you will need to download & use 4.8.6.4. OpenCascade/Cocoa - it appears that GNU autotools are not able to build cocoa version hence I have used cmake.  In order to do so, you will need to download OCCT 6.9.1 from OCC web site separately & prepare it for use.5. Non-Apple compilers cannot be used to build Python & Qt, as a result, I have built all the pre-requisites & salome itself using only Apple compilers.  Among other dependencies, I have GNU Autotools installed at /opt/local using macports & a fortran compiler (gfortran 4.9).Steps for compiling:1. Download a complete linux version of Salome, I have used the one for Fedora 22.  In these instructions, I have assumed that salome will be installed in /opt/salome.  Extract the downloaded Salome binaries into this folder & delete the linux binaries as we will be building from source.<code>tar --gunzip -xf /path/to/SALOME-7.8.0-OPENSOURCE-FD22.tgzmv SALOME-7.8.0-OPENSOURCE-FD22 /opt/salomecd /opt/salomerm -rf PREREQUISITES/INSTALL/*rm -rf INSTALL/*</code>2. Download Qt 4.8.6 & OCC 6.9.1, prepare tarballs for both.  For OCCT 6.9.1, you need to apply a patch that is included in the salome distribution.<code>tar --gunzip -xf opencascade-6.9.1.tgzcd opencascade-6.9.1/patch -p1 < /opt/salome/PREREQUISITES/Patches/OCCT-6.9.1.patchrm -rf doc/cd ..mv opencascade-6.9.1 CAS-6.9.1p1tar --gzip -cf CAS-6.9.1p1.tar.gz CAS-6.9.1p1tar --gunzip -xf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.6.tar.gzmv qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.6 qt-4.8.6tar --gzip -cf qt-4.8.6.tar.gz qt-4.8.6cp CAS-6.9.1p1.tar.gz /opt/salome/PREREQUISITES/SOURCES/cp qt-4.8.6.tar.gz /opt/salome/PREREQUISITES/SOURCES/</code>3. Download patches (from the links below) into same folder & extract it.<code>tar --gunzip -xf salome_7.8_mac.tar.gz</code>4. Apply the patches against the prerequisites & salome tools:<code>patch -p1 < salome_7.8_mac/Salome_prerequisites.patch</code>5. Prepare the Salome sources & apply patch for salome sources:<code>./sat prepare SALOME_7_8_0_OPENSOURCEpatch -p0 < salome_7.8_mac/Salome_srcs.patch</code>6. Copy the patches & files to be used by the salomeTools intaller:<code>cp salome_7.8_mac/qt-4.8.6.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/python-2.7.10.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/cppunit-1.2.1.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/freeimage-3.1.6.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/CAS-6.9.1p1-mac.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/CAS-6.9.1-xcode.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/tk-8.6.0.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/libxml2-2.9.0.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/scotch-5.1.12.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/opencv-2.4.6.1.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/netgen-4.9.13.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/ParaView.patch PREREQUISITES/Patches/cp salome_7.8_mac/CAS_6.9.1-cmake.sh salomeTools/data/compil_scripts/prerequisites/</code>7. Compile the pre-requisites, this could take a few hours:<code>./sat prerequisite SALOME_7_8_0_OPENSOURCE</code>8. Once all pre-requisites are compiled successfully, compile the Salome sources<code>./sat compile SALOME_7_8_0_OPENSOURCE</code>9. Create the launcher<code>./sat launcher SALOME_7_8_0_OPENSOURCE</code>10. Run Salome:<code>export SALOME_VERBOSE=1./salome</code>Links:Patches:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0hN-su06AafZHVObDhMOUJ3OVE/view?usp=sharingScreenshot:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0hN-su06AafTFFWbTFfQy1ZSGcRegards,Venkat",
                "Hello VenkatThat's a impressive job you just did ! I'm not a Mac user but congrats to successfully have compiled SALOME on this platform !I'm pretty confident that many users will be happy to test this version.Best regards,Gilles",
                "Congrats Venkat for this work! Could you provide a package so that we can test this more easily? We don't have computers with Mac OS X in Salome team, but we can try at home. We could add official Mac OS X support if the tests results are good.Thank you and best regards,Christophe",
                "Good day Christophe,I am not sure if I can create a self-contained binary package, there may be some stray dependencies or version conflicts on dylibs/frameworks outside of the /opt/salome folder.  Though that should be a long term goal.Would it be possible for you to try installing from source on the mac computer.  The procedure is really quite simple because of salome tools & is exactly the same as for linux but for the following differences, which are described above:Disabling of system integrity protection - this requires a reboot.GNU Autotools need to be installed, possibly via macports / fink / homebrew.Downloading & repackaging of Qt-4.8.6 & OCCT 6.9.1.Applying all the patches.If that is not possible then let me know and I can try to zip and upload the complete salome folder somewhere, (around 2.9GB).  Note that my machine is running El Capitan and this may not work on Sierra.It will certainly be great to have official support for Mac OS X and I will be happy to assist in any way possible.Regards,Venkat",

                "Hello.I use Salome 7.5.1 and 7.6.0 to build meshes for CFD calculations. I need to set up my engineering software on Linux CentOS 6.5. This distro doesn't havenouveaudrivernouveau_dri.soin/usr/lib64/driso I installed this file manually from package \"mesa-dri-drivers-8.0.5-1.el6.elrepo.x86_64\" (my laptop has nVidia graphics). After thatgeometrymodule of Salome 7.6.0 started to draw graphycs with normal speed, butmesh drawing is still extremely slow. Moving or rotating the mesh containing just ~10 miilions of cells with mouse is almost impossible. It seems that meshing module in Salome uses software rendering. How can I debug/diagnose/correct it?",
                "HiTry to switch OFF selection in the VTK Viewer. For that un-checkEnable/Disable selectionbutton in the viewer toolbar:St.Michael",
                "Thanks for suggestion but it didn't help. I can't even select area, responce is too slow and actually no zoom-to-box appears. It appears to be a grapgics driver issue because I don't remember this problem on my home PC with Ubuntu 12.04 and the exactly same mesh.",
                "I searched the internet for this topic and found nothing... How can I determine what driver is now being used by Salome for mesh rendering? Is it normal that 10-million mesh cannot be normally viewed in Salome? If it's not normal, what should I check?Are there any workaround for slow rendering cases like software rendering? I tried wireframe mesh representation but id doesn't speed-up rotation/panning/e.t.c. Even single mesh redraw takes significznt time (several seconds).",
                "Hi,Have you checked that direct rendering is working?glxinfo |grep directHave you tried to install the proprietary Nvidia drivers instead?Christophe",
                "ChristopheHello.Sorry for late response, there was no replies for long time and I forgot about the topic. The command you mentioned says \"direct rendering: Yes\". Nice graphics fromglxgearsare also OK. It seems that some programs (OpenCascade) work with video driver on my CentOS 6.5 OK (after copyingnouveau_dri.sointo/usr/lib64/dri), some are not (VTK). Perhaps I must say to the system to \"publish\" or \"register\" this new*_drilibrary but I don't know how...I think it's another CentOS specific problem (I could forget about this distro but I need it as freeware Linux for Ansys, there are lots of problems with Ansys installation, for example, on Ubuntu). I tried to compile Mesa-9.2.0 from sources but there are strange issues with DRM version in CentOS-6.5 and undefined references while compiling Mesa with DRI (I compiled Mesa successfully without DRI for offscreen rendering for co-processing with Code-Saturne).So now I also asked this question on CentOS forum:https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=54006",
                "Still no success... I tried to compile all required libraries for nouveau:http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau/But I don't even know and coudn't find what are kernel versions compatible with particular libdrm and Xf86-video-nouveau versions.Is there a way to diagnose VTK video driver problems in Salome? Maybe I just need to edit some configuration files to tell VTK to use/usr/lib64/dri/nouveau_dri.soinstead of software rendering (like OpenCascade does)?I wondered that there is no solution easily found on the Internet. CentOS is quite known distribution and Salome is widely used... I found only several questions resembling mine without correct solutions...",
                "I solved the problem, may be not best way, but now VTK in Salome seems to work OK.On CentOS forum I was told to makeyum update. I did it and after reboot obtain only base desktop resolution (1024x768) without hardware acceleration. IMHO, current CentOS kernel (2.6.32-573.3.1.el6.x86_64) doesn't support my GT555M. So I decided to install nVidia proprietary video driver (I described details on CentOS forum, see the link above). Yes, I needed to \"patch\" (dracut) the kernel, but I had previous kernel in GRUB menu and had not another simple mean to obtain correct video drivers.Sorry, but, IMHO, Salome needs some kind of \"dashboard\" GUI window to inform the user about video driver currently used by OpenCascade and VTK and problems that may have been appeared while trying to initialize \"normal\" (hardware-accelerated) graphics. In my case on previous CentOS 6.5 kernel I had nice graphics while booting and on the desktop with correct resolution, \"Direct rendering: Yes\" in glxinfo output. So It was not obvious that video driver needed update."

Can you check if it works also with Intel cards?- Download Mesa3d for Windows:mesa3d-18.3.4-release-sfx.exe- Extract it (either with double-click or right-click 7-zip)- In the extraction folder of Mesa, go to x64, select and copy opengl32.dll- In the extraction folder of Salome, go to MODULES\\INSTALL\\GUI\\RELEASE\\GUI_INSTALL\\bin\\salome and paste opengl32.dll- Double-click on run_salome.batNow VTK view of SMESH and Paraview view of PARAVIS should open without error.Christophe",

                "So I've fixed (I think) the issues I've had. tl;dr is that there's a dependency on using Python 2.X, but all references to that are simply \"python\" instead of \"python2\". That basically screwed up everything, nor do I understand why they didn't just specify \"python2\".I'm currently running into an error with the installation. Here's the message that I get:<pre><code>=======================================Self Extracting Salome V8_4_0 Installer=======================================Enter the Salome install directory [default=/home/u2berggeist/salome] :Salome is in English, do you want to be in French ?

The files that it names do exist though, inside \"~/salome/Salome-V8_4_0-univ\". It gets the directory to look up these files by using a short python expression inside \"create_appli.sh\":<pre><code>if test -z \"$SALOMEDIR\"; thenSALOMEDIR=`python -c \"import os; print os.path.normpath(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(os.path.realpath('$0'))))\" 2>/dev/null`fi</code></pre>A) When I run this code, it comes up with an error. I have to change \"python\" to \"python2\" to get the script to work.B) When the script works, I get \"/bin\". \"/bin\" isn't where these files are located. Not even remotely. I'm honestly not sure what this part of the script was supposed to be doing.To fix this, I just hardcoded the \"$SALOMEDIR\" to the \"~/salome/Salome-V8_4_0-univ\". After that change it worked.... sort of.The directory it installed it into was \"~/salome/Salome-V8_4_0-univ/y\". Not sure where the \"y\" came from. I tried to run \"y/salome\" and again ran into python errors this time.I'll skip the nitty gritty, but at the end, I had to replace \"#! /usr/bin/env python\" with \"\"#! /usr/bin/env python2\" to get it to work. I'll look into submitting a bug report, as this seems like a pretty large oversight. Most people have installations of python 2 and 3.",

However current versions of Salome won't work with this driver:- the mentioned files are not provided with Salome, you should download them fromhttp://www.3dconnexion.com/support/sdk.php- you need a recent version of VTK which should then be compiled with the correct environment variables to detect the library xdrvlib- once VTK has been compiled, Salome needs to be compiled too.Currently the version in Salome V5 is too old, and I don't think that Salome V5 is compatible with a recent version of VTK (to check).Maybe this spaceball driver can be included into Salome V6 (planned in 2011) but I'm not the one who takes the decisionsGilles",

I am also using Ubuntu 18.04 and tested the functionality using the universal binaries package. I am now in the process of downloading the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS version to see if this is an issue related to the \"universal binaries\" version.As a side note, I have noticed that python scripts that used to work in 8.4 need some changes in 8.5. Particularly, for operations that rely on edge selection (e.g. chamfer). The numerical labels for the edges need to be revisited and updated for the scripts to work in 8.5. Reasonably straight forward to correct/change for simple(ish) geometries.Thanks,Humberto",

How to build SALOME modules from sources\" and get stuck at the very first step. First of all I couldn't find env_build.sh fil, so i just copied it from the already installed Salome.

Is there a possibility to download via \"git\" one of the module f.e. \"SMESH_SRC.git\" and replace with already exisitng folder in the Salome.

                "Hello Andrzej,For the current moment the build procedure of SALOME platform is being migrated from GNU auto-tools (automake/autoconf) to CMake. The main goal of this work is to have one build procedure on Linux and Windows.Mentioned changes are integrated to the development branch V7_main.Unfortunately, these changes are not yet reflected in the documentation, this will be done later.Here are instructions how to build SALOME modules with CMake (currently, this concerns KERNEL, GUI and MED modules):mkdir KERNEL_BUILDcd KERNEL_BUILDcmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_path>makemake installwhere install_path is a directory where KERNEL module should be installed to (what was referenced with --prefix option of configure command previously). Note that this directory should be then referenced in the environment via KERNEL_ROOT_DIR variable (to allow building other modules).Other, not listed above modules, are built with previous build procedure, described in readme.The only remark - CMake-based build procedure might require some specific environment variables to be set, to specify paths to pre-requisite products, otherwise it can fail. Standard environment (which comes from universal binaries of SALOME installation wizard) does not set these variables, but CMake will hint about required environment variables during configuration step.Regards,Vadim.",

                "Hi, as quite a few users before, I got the \"GUI library corresponding to the user action not found\" error when trying to use the \"explode\" feature in the geometry workspace. The issue turned out to be a library version mis-match, where the universal binary expected an older version of libraries than the host system (Debian unstable). Here is what I did to debug and fix this:First, I started a new shell in the SALOME-9.7.0-MPI directory:```# Set up Salome specific include paths etc, so that ldd finds Salome internal dependenciessource env_launch.sh# Check which libraries / symbols are missingldd -r BINARIES-CO7/GEOM/lib/salome/libEntityGUI.so```This identified mismatches in libglib2.0-0, libpango-1.0-0, and libpangoft2-1.0-0, partly based on symbols that had been removed in newer versions. To fix this, I used Debian's package pages to manually fetch older versions from Debian stable (libglib2.0-0_2.66.8-1_amd64.deb, libpango-1.0-0_1.46.2-3_amd64.deb, libpangoft2-1.0-0_1.46.2-3_amd64.deb) to a directory.```> lslibglib2.0-0_2.66.8-1_amd64.deb libpango-1.0-0_1.46.2-3_amd64.deb libpangoft2-1.0-0_1.46.2-3_amd64.deb# Unpack each deb using `dpkg -x`> for i in *.deb;do dpkg -x \"$i\" /tmp/unpack; done# Unpacked libraries now in /tmp/unpack/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, copy them into the Salome installcp -r /tmp/unpack/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/* BINARIES-CO7/system_dep/# Double check dependencies, hopefully nothing is missing nowldd -r BINARIES-CO7/GEOM/lib/salome/libEntityGUI.so```Hope this helps,GabrielPS: Would it make sense to include these libraries in the next universal binary release?",

Can someone send me a complete medmem library or direct me how to solve this problem?If I change type FIELD<double> with FIELD_, my code can be compiled well except that the function myField.setValueIJ can not be found. Is there a function for me to set the value of FIELD_ type?Many thanksBest wishes,Shiquan"

                "Hi,I have built salome 3.2.6 on Ubuntu 8.04. Some modifications were needed to the source and I have listed them in this email. I have run a couple of tests and things seem to be working ok so far. This is not an automated build process, hence a some manual tweaking will be needed.This file lists the changes to build salome. The 3.2.6 package isbeing used, and the changes made are listed below:-- the build script (and not the installer GUI) was used from the command line to build the package. To build the dependency packages, goto the Install.../config_files directory and type the following:./{package}.sh [install_binary | install_source] {tmp_build_dir}{package_dir} {install_dir}-- following lines are added before the ./configure commands in thebuild script for tcl8.4.5check_job ${PRODUCT_DIR}/CONFIGURE.LOG aclocalcheck_job ${PRODUCT_DIR}/CONFIGURE.LOG autoconfThis is so that the aclocal and configure scripts are regeneratedfor the local machines.next, the following lines are added to the configure.in file for tcl8.4.5AC_SUBST(EXTRA_CFLAGS)AC_SUBST(MKLINKS_FLAGS)AC_SUBST(SHLIB_LD_FLAGS)The tar.gz package is built again with these changes-- the same is to be done for tk8.4.5-- for compilation of qt-3.3.4, the following flag had to be added tothe configuration script, since it was otherwise unable to find thefreetype/internal headers, which are a part of the freetype sourcepackage, and not the development headers. The freetype packge wasdownloaded (2.1.10 was used, since the latest 2.3.x wasincompatible with this version of qt). The following was added tothe configure options of qt in the build script of qt3.3.4 (note that this is not the installation directory, but the directory of the freetype source package).-I/home/manav/packages/freetype/freetype-2.1.10/include-- used the patches for some files in the occ package, and it compiledok. The patch file was obtained from this page:http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~kraftche/OCC/patches.htmlThe patch is called occ6.2.patch. Note that the patch on this website is suited for the OCC source code downloaded from the OCC website. The one available with salome is slightly different in organization, but the source files seem to be the same. I manually applied the changes to the source code by skipping all the patches to the configure scripts. There aren't too many changes, hence, it is doable by hand.-- for med, the script was unable to find the hdf path, and hence,this was added to the configure command in med build script file.-- the configure script was having problems for CMAKE. The prebuiltbinaries for 1.6.7 were downloaded from cmake.org/files and used tobuild VTK. The build script for VTK-4.2.6 had to be modified bycommenting out any lines that built the cmake utility, and thecmake-1.6.6/Sources/cmake was modified to cmake-1.6.6/bin/cmakeSome definitions of a few functions had to be added to a few cxxfiles in the VTK source. The vtk environment variables were added to theKERNEL_SRC_3.2.6/salome.sh file.-- following this, KERNEL was built with the following command./build.sh -bcdoi KERNELHowever, before this, the environment variables have to be set bysourcing the salome.sh (in KERNEL_SRC directory) file. Please note that the enviromnent variables for LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and {package}_ROOT_DIR had to be added to this file, since it was not automatically done.In addition to this, a change had to be made in the configure.acfile to be able to build the configure script. This is because fortesting the hdf library, libz was not being added to the librarylist during linking. Hence, the following command was added toconfigure.ac to add the library:dnl add library libz :AC_CHECK_LIB(z,compress2)-- for installation of GUI module, a newline had to be inserted at theend of the file adm_local/unix/config_files/check_vtk.m4 in theGUI_SRC directory. This was otherwise preventing the aclocalcommand from succeeding.The check for z library also had to be added (like that for KERNEL).-- The ckeck for z library was added to the configure.in.base file asfor GUI.-- For compilation of MED, the first line of build_configure scripthad to be changed from /bin/sh to /bin/bash.This also needed some small changes in the source code,particularly about definition of namespace for a few friendoperators.-- For SMESH, the check for z library was added to theconfigure.in.base file.-- For VISU, the check for z library was added to theconfigure.in.base file.-- For SUPERV, the check for z library was added to theconfigure.in.base file.-- For NETGENPLUGIN, the check for z library was added to theconfigure.in.base file.-- For COMPONENT, the check for z library was added and the /bin/shwas changed to /bin/bash for build_configure.-- For CALCULATOR, the /bin/sh was changed to /bin/bash forbuild_configure. Also, the following was added to theconfigure.in.base filednl Library libdl :AC_CHECK_LIB(dl,dlopen)dnl add library libm :AC_CHECK_LIB(m,ceil)dnl add library libz :AC_CHECK_LIB(z,compress2)and the following was added to add the pthread option tocompilation for testing hdf. Without this, hdf was not beingproperly tested, and was being disabled for the module.echoecho ---------------------------------------------echo testing threadsecho ---------------------------------------------echoENABLE_PTHREADSThis should give some people enough background to build their package.Regards,Manav",

However, there seem to be some incompatibilities between the latest ubuntu packages and the salome 3.2.6 source. Hence, I decided to use the source packages that came with salome itself.From previous posts it seems that there is some development work (by the developers of salome) going on to improve upon this dependency, however, we do not have access to that source code, and there is no indication about when it will be released. There have been independent efforts by other users, like Adam Powell, to work out these dependencies, but I am not sure of how far he was able to get.As for my binary, I could upload it to a website, if others would like to download and use. I am not sure of the legal aspects of the same though.Regards,Manav",

Can you check at what step splash screen is frozen? Usually it displays the current status of SALOME launching process like \"Waiting for session server...\", \"Waiting for C++ container...\", \"Activating desktop...\" etc.Also, can you check what SALOME processes have been started after you launched SALOME? You can do it with ps command, e.g.:ps -ef | grep SALOMERegards,Vadim.",

            "discussion": [
                "I have a very simple compilation problem on RHEL6, and I would like the best recommendation to overcome it. On Red-Hat, most 64-bit shared libraries are located on directory /usr/lib64/ but old 32-bit libraries are often left at their original location. During the compilation of Salome using \"python runInstall\", I click \"Install sources and make a compilation\". During the installation of gl2ps, I got the following message:/usr/local/lib/libGLU.so : could not read symbols : File in wrong formatThe problem is caused by the search path of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The libGLU.so library found is an old 32-bit library. The correct library is located in /usr/lib64/libGLU.so.To correct the situation, I tried to add \"/usr/lib64:\" at start of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in line 1169 of runInstall script. Without success. Of course, my system administrator refuse to modify /usr/local/lib/.Any suggestion?",
                "No reply after 5 days, so I decided to solve the problem by myself. The problem is caused by two makefiles files making references to old 32-bit libraries in building gl2ps. This is apparently not a problem on Debian/Calibre systems over which SALOME is developed, but is harmful on RHEL6. By the fact, RHEL6 is frequently used in industry and academia in North-America. It would be nice to investigate if this is a bug or a feature. The faulty files are:salome_6.6.0/gl2ps-1.3.5_SRC/CMakeCache.txtsalome_6.6.0/gl2ps-1.3.5_SRC/CMakeFiles/shared.dir/build.makeThe corrected files are attached.",
                "Hello Alain,I dont quite understand where the problem comes from.Is it from the Salome build procedure or from gl2ps itself ?The OpenGL libraries are detected using a CMake macro: find_package(OpenGL). If the libraries are badly detected then it comes from this macro.Did you fix the CMakeLists.txt in the gl2ps source directory and then generated the files, or did you change the CMakeCache.txt manually ?Regards,Gilles",
                "What I did was to fix directly the two files mentioned in my post and to relaunch \"python runInstall\". It works. However, I did not check if these two files were generated previously by a CMake macro. Sorry.",
                "The mentioned files are generated by the detection process of CMake. You can help it by setting proper values for some variables. This is what you did by manually chaging CMakeCache.txt.Anyway, this problem seems not specific to Salome but related to gl2ps.To be sure, one should compile gl2ps independently of Salome to check where the OpenGl libraries are detected.",
                "My conclusions at this point:To compile SALOME on RHEL6, I patched the following CMake generated files:salome_6.6.0/gl2ps-1.3.5_SRC/CMakeCache.txtsalome_6.6.0/gl2ps-1.3.5_SRC/CMakeFiles/shared.dir/build.makesalome_6.6.0/ParaView-3.14.0_build/MakeCache.txtThe patch consists to replace \"/usr/local/lib/libGLU.so\" by /usr/lib64/libGLU.so\" and \"/usr/local/lib/libz.a\" by \"/usr/lib64/libz.so\".After 20 hour compilation time, a SALOME executable is produced. However, two modules are missing in the list: YACS and PARAVIS.Install report is attached.Moreover, the compilation doesn't solve my initial Geometry-module problem with the precompiled version. In Geometry, if I select \"New\", I got \"GlxChooseVisual failed\". If I move the mouse, I got \"SIGSEGV segmentation violation detected\".Nightmare continue... Should I use a Debian system?",

Is it normal (are these libraries only needed for compilation, and SALOME-7.6.0-WIN64.exe being a compiled file, it is normal that these libraries do not appear anymore?If so, should I be able to find them in the windows Salome compilation environment \"SALOME SDK self-extracting archive\"?I thank you in advance for your help.Best regards,Pierre",
                "Hello Pierre,On Windows, the libraries have .lib suffix, not .a. These files (.lib) are not delivered with \"standard\" binaries packages. Development files (headers, libs, etc) are only included into DEV and SDK packages of SALOME.Further, libblas and liblapack libraries are a part of lapack product, which is needed, in particular, for numpy. Lapack is not deliveried with SALOME binaries packages on Windows, as it requires FORTRAN compiler.If necessary, you can build lapack yourself provided that you have FORTRAN compiler on your Windows workstation (such as, for instance, Intel Fortran Compiler). Also, you can try to use pre-built version of lapack, see here for more details:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/.Regards,Vadim.",
                "Hi Vadim,Thank you very much for you detailed answer.I may come back asking further questions. (I guess re-using MED library from Salome may be for instance relevant).Bests,Pierre",
                "Hi Vadim,Please, a short question regarding the differences between lib and dll files:- on the LAPACK website, it is stated that lib files (libblas.lib & liblapack.lib) have to be positionned in the same directory thatthe one where are located the sources of the program that calls blas and lapack libraries).- additionnally, for the executable obtained after compilation to run, one should have in the directory where the executable is located the libblas.dll and liblapack.dll.You do not mention that,nor a websiteI could find explaining how to obtain by compilation the libblas.lib and liblapack.lib files. In your opinion, should I do that?Or is it possible that the .dll files are not required once program has been compiled (static libraries vs. dynamic libraries)?Indeed, I can see that the libblas.lib and lblapack.lib I obtain by compiling from sources are much bigger than the libblas.lib and liblapack.lib I downloaded from thewebsite you mentionned.I thank you in advance for your help.Best regards,Pierre",
                "Hi,Please, I do have a 2nd short question regarding this time libhdf5.a that is required by Code_Aster (to read MED files).In Salome DEV package, I couldn't find a file starting with libhdf5, but I did find a hdf5.lib.Vadim, do you know if hdf5.lib provided in Salome DEV package is a static library?If so I guess I could safely rename it libhdf5.a to re-use it for my Code_Aster compilation. Do you think so?I thank you in advance for your help.Best regards,Pierre",
                "I guess that in your case you get static libraries of lapack (*.lib). In that case you don't need dynamic libraries (*.dll) - as everything what is needed for the program being linked against lapack is in these static libraries. When you build a program it just absorbs static libraries and you will not need them anymore.In case of dynamic libraries *.lib only contain information for the linker needed when linking a program against lapack. In this case, as soon as program is built, you don't need *.lib files anymore. However, you have to provide a way to access dynamic libraries when your program is running. This can be achieved either by putting libraries to the same directory where the program's executable is or setting environment properly by adding directory with the dynamic libraries into the PATH variable. This is how SALOME does that for all pre-requisites.",
                "See here for instance:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library.Regarding hdf5 - in SALOME 7.6.0 SDK you can see in PRODUCTS\\hdf5-1.8.10\\lib directory hdf5.lib which is a static library and hdf5dll.lib which is a mentioned interface description for hdf5.dll dynamic library.I don't know if the trick with renaming can help.

                "In my continuing efforts to build med-3.2.1 yesterday late in the day, I finally figured out that if one uses ./configure options such as ./configure --with hdf5-include=/usr/local/hdf5/include, then the configure script will look in the right place for missing header files or libraries or whatever it needs.  However, having fixed that problem, now the ./configure ends with yet another error because it is unhappy with the hdf5 version (too recent!).  So installed an older version of hdf5, and ./configure proceeded to the next error, it is unhappy with the Python version it finds.  Tracking down all these errors and trying to fix them seems to be the wrong path toward getting a working version of SALOME up and running.  And even if one could get a successful ./configure, the changes would have to be incorporated in the sat scripts.  I have no appetite to plunge into editing sat.My conclusion is that the present SALOME build procedure and sat script simply can't do the job they are intended to do, and that maintaining a useful build process is beyond the scope of an ordinary SALOME would-be user.So, unless some good Samaritan out there comes to the rescue, I am not going to devote further time to this unproductive pursuit.",
                "Hello John,Indeed building SALOME from sources is a challenge itself. At CEA and EDF, specific tools (like SAT or YAMM) are developed and used to achieve this, on specific supported platforms. For instance at EDF, only Debian 6 and 8 are supported.I'm afraid Ubuntu 17.04 is a too recent distribution, not supported by the latest version of SALOME. You can find the supported prerequisites versions in therelease note.I suggest to try to solve the problem related to the graphic driver when using the universal libraries, or maybe use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS version.Best regards,Gilles",

Neither the fglrx nor the fglrx-updates driver from the distribution packages solve the error above.I succeeded finally by downloading and installing the driver fromhttp://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspxBut attention: direct installation breaks the x-server which you'd probably want to avoid!It finally worked by generating and installing the distribution specific packages (which may conveniently also be done with the installer downloaded from the AMD website). You'll have, however, also to install some programs for deb-package building which are not normally part of a standard installation.

It should be replaced by another directroy where you copy the only needed library for Salome. To know what they are, just comment the etchForSalome part and launch Salome. When it complaints about a missing library, copy it from etchForSalome/lib to a new directory (which should be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

                "Interesting, this too is a fresh install.  I wonder if it has something to do with the graphics capability on this machine.  I remember having issues running Abaqus CAE on this machine.  Its mainly a server/number cruncher with fairly mediocre graphics.  I could get CAE to run with -vesa option.  Is there a more verbose way to launch Salome so I can see what is going on?  Doesn't seem to have a \"-v\" option.Thanks, Dave",

So I give you here \"my\" solution to this problem:(I uses Salome-5.1.5 on debian lenny 32bits)1) BLSurf, GHS3D, HEXOTIC are not free, they are commercial tools from Distene. But you can get a free trial (or buy them) here:http://www.distene.com/en/corp/eval-distene.htmlorhttp://www.distene.com/fr/corp/eval-distene.html(in french)2) What you need is:-3 libs for BLSurf: libBLSurf.so, .0 libPreCAD.so and libdistene.so-exec file for ghs3d-exec file for hexotic-a key file (dlim8.key)from Distene(files for blsurf and ghs3d can be found in Salome-meca, I don't know about hexotic one since my version of salome-meca is based on 5.1.4, and it seems that hexotic was not implemented in it... but I might be wrong!)3) what I did (so what you can try) is:-copied the libs to .../salome_5.1.5/BLSURFPLUGIN_5.1.5/lib/salome-made links for the 2 exec files to a folder in $PATH (/usr/local/bin) with names \"ghs3d\" and \"hexotic\" (and made them executables)-added in runAppli file:DISTENE_LICENSE_FILE=nama/of/directory/license/dlim8.key(this is an example of course!)export DISTENE_LICENSE_FILEI hope that can help, feel free to complete my post or to add remarksif it's not clear enoughJérémie",

I think that if you get a free trial version or purchase a Distene product,, they will sent to you the binaries along with the licence key.Once they are installed, you should modify the following environment variables:For BlSurf: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/blsurf/libs:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}For Ghs3D: export PATH=path/to/ghs3d/executable:${PATH}For Hexotic: export PATH=path/to/hexotic/executable:${PATH}Concerning the licence file, it is well documented by Distene. Your procedure is fine for a local key.

Assuming you downloaded the latest stable MEDCOUPLING archive from the download section:https://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version, here is what you have to do:tar zxvf MEDCOUPLING-9.6.0-CO6-SRC-.tar.gzcd MEDCOUPLING-9.6.0-CO6-SRCsource env_launch.shpythonimport medcoupling as mcIn case you want to compile everything from scratch you need to do: (for CentOS 6, you need to have at hand a more modern gcc compiler, you can for instance install devtoolset)cd MEDCOUPLING-9.6.0-CO6-SRC./install_bin.sh./sat prepare MEDCOUPLIGN-9.6.0./sat compile MEDCOUPLING-9.6.0./sat environ MEDCOUPLING-9.6.0then to run MEDCOUPLING, you have to source the env_launch.sh script to consistently define PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.. and launch pythonpython -iimport medcoupling as mcor/python my_medcoupling.py script.HTH.Note, that if you compile everything from scratch,openssl-devel needs to be installed on your workstation",

The build procedure used with SALOME 7.3.0 is a first step towards the porting from automake to cmake. We only succeeded to check base configurations, and cannot guarantee that all combinations of options work properly.Sorry for inconvenience, we suppose to proceed with debugging / improving of the build procedure in future versions of SALOME.Just interesting, why do you use custom configuration options set? Do you build your own application based on SALOME that requires specific configuration?Regards,Vadim.",

Right now I succeeded in compiling and installing the KERNEL module with some patches.

I have some experience packaging with autotools and making debs.I'm new to Salome/Code_Aster, and want to compile them from sources.The problem, as was stated above is the standardless way the sources are distributed. If we reorganize the sources to complain with the GNU Autotools model, the deb packaging is almost ready to go without much effort.So far I have just compiled Salome kernel, since I'm pretty busy on these days. I found that the code lacks some C++ standarization in the way some headers are included. Seems like it's compiled with an old version of GNU compiler collection(newer versions are stricter). But wasn't that difficult to solve since C++ is my preferred language.So, I have a question for you more experienced Salome Users. Where can I find some up to date documentation about the environment variables to be set, and the dependency tree between the different salome modules? also I need to know a bit more about how all these stuff integrated to make the final app. I know I can find it myself, but would be great if you help me with this info...By the way, I'm on Ubuntu 9.10 amd64. But since I'm working on the sources, I should be able to package both 64 and 32 bit versions.Greetings, Felipe.",

I downloaded one of these, and found that there is a lot information in the archives, perhaps too much.http://www.salome-platform.org/user-section/documentation-archiveI also suspect that the python scripts that come with Salome, Salome Meca, and CAE Linux, would suggest the paths.Thank you for your interest. : )",
                "Well, I noticed that Salome and Code_Aster are releasing new versions at the end of November aprox. So decided to wait for these brand new versions to start with the packaging work. I already installed code_aster 10.0.x on my system, but there are runtime issues related with python. Since all major issues are likely to be solved on next relases, it's better to wait some weeks.Will be waiting for the new versions to go... hope to have news soon.Best Regards, Felipe.PS: So for me the current package candidates are Salome 5.1.3, Code_Aster 10.0.x, Code_Saturn ? I want to create something like a CAE repository. Brl-cad and OpenFoam are candidates too. I already have them installed from sources.",
                "I think that code_saturne is at 2.0.0 beta, which is supposed to use modern compilers. I understand you wanting to wait.I would be really neat if these programs were upgradeable without breaking everything.Outside CAELinux, I think that very few people have these programs going. It's really sad to see software with such promise languish because they weren't designed to play well with a production operating system, meaning one that can touch the internet without getting hacked, because it cannot be updated.[Even with the last CAE, I have done a few tests with code_saturne and Salome that looked remarkable, but I am only getting 1/30 tests working, and I do not know where I am going wrong. In some tests I have air going over an airfoil perfectly; in others, it looks like the outlet pyramid surfaces are not being honored.]",
                "Ok, I haven't tried code_saturne.The fact is I'm trying to organize a complete CAE toolchain to work mainly in Aerospace/Mechanics/Communications. What we need is a 3D CAD, a good FEM(supporting composite materials), CFD, and Electro Magnetic simulation tools. So far we have OpenFOAM for CFD, brl-cad for CAD, and looking for a good FEM tool we found code_aster. Now, after reading the forums I see there's code_saturn so now there are two CFD options.The funny part is I have never used these Software, since I'm from the Electronics/Communications area I'm just building and installing...(so far). Hope to see the software in action soon.With code_aster 10.00.26 I'm still getting 11 of 29 tests with error. Hope that the new release will solve all these problems."

However, you will not be able to compile SALOME then - this is because med 3.0.6 SDK files require some additional attuning after installation (this is done automatically by Install Wizard).3) Ensure that environment for med 3.0.6 is properly set by env_products.sh (if med is not installed, the corresponding environment section might be missing too.

Note, that one products depend on other ones, so on each step you will need to set-up proper environment (PATH, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc) for each product, not depending is it built manually or used natively.Better to use some super-script for these reasons.

                "Yes, Vadim is right.The pre-compiled binary of McCad is linked with specific version of SALOME, thus might not compatible with other version.The compilation of McCad under the latest version of SALOME is laborious, because the Open Cascade library on which McCad is based is changed without very good backward compatibility. Therefore, we have to change our code and test again.Anyway, if there is any urgent needs, I will try to make it.Regards,Yuefeng",
                "Dear Salome Experts,in the last few days, I looked over the McCad documentation and the different versions for Salome and SpaceClaim (Thanks to Yuefeng and KIT). It's really a great technology!I am planning to perform some more tests with more complicated geometries and hexameshing with the SMESH module in the next few weeks and discuss the results in our FB group in some online meetings. Is someone else using it and want to share the experience with me? I think there is huge potential.Best,Damian"

I know that I can find Salome-meca 2009.1 but as I noticed Salome is v.4.1.6 and Code Aster is v9.4. I'd like tu install the latest versions of software on my Ubuntu 9.04.

                "Hi,Code Aster version 10 goes pretty well under Ubuntu 9.04 64b. I prefer Intel compilers, you can download from herehttps://registrationcenter.intel.com/RegCenter/AutoGen.aspx?ProductID=1317&AccountID=&EmailID=&ProgramID=&RequestDt=&rm=NCOM&lang=download for you system both C++ and Fortran and install. GCC is function too, but I haven't such experience with this. For Code Aster you need some libraries. List is herehttp://www.code-aster.org/wiki/doku.php?id=en:p02_install:compil_ubuntuor herehttp://www.code-aster.org/forum2/viewtopic.php?id=12352Next you can compile (there could be some errors or missing libraries, just fix them) Code Aster with setup.cfg (just chnge username and version of Intel compilers). After this you can run some simple tests.For Salome you need I thing thislibgfortran.so.2libcppunit-1.12.so.0or you can make from newer version link.If you want to start jobs from Salome to Code Aster just look athttp://www.caelinux.com/for python script CreateJob.pyIt's some days I did that so if there some mistake or understanding I apologize. But I think some people get here some ideas too.P.S. read the forum at Code Aster and Salome, you can learne there more. It is bit longer but necessary.Regards jrz",

                "Hello developers,I tried using YACS and it always returned Segmentation Fault at 0x15 address. The OS-es that I tested it on was on Debian 10 and CentOS 8 (Compiled SALOME from sources). Even the provided distributions (at least for Debian 10) crashed when I tried activating the YACS module.I do not know how much YACS is in use, but I am willing to have a go with it since I have parametric simulation study and I would like to see if YACS scripting is a viable option.Long story short, debugging for a long time and having no C++ experience, the problem was simple. The  bool CatalogWidget::addCatalogFromFile returned nothing when it loaded a Catalog and for some reason it called the underlying CatalogWidget::addCatalog twice, with the second call having no initialized arguments, leading to UB. At least that is what valgrind reported. So adding a simple return true at the end of the function solves the problem. The module finally loads.I've checked YACS git repository (9.5.0) and the code haven't changed. So attached is the patch file.Another note: Running salome with the following options./salome start --gdb-session./salome start --ddd-sessionFails on Debian 10 due to miss-matched SRE versions in python modules. gdb and ddd uses system python which then tries to import packages from the SALOME environment and since the Python versions differ (3.7 from system and 3.6 from SALOME) these sessions fail to start.Final question, any news about 9.5.0 release date?Best regards",

                "Hello everybody,I\nwould like to make a general answer to the very common question from Linux beginners:How to install Salome on Linux?Here are \"step by step\" and detailed instructions.IMPORTANT: all these actions should NOT be made as root.Best regards,William1-Install Wizard Process(deprecated since 7.6.0- Site Administrator )Using theInstall\nWizardis the classical way to install Salome. In case of failure, the user can then try to use theuniversal binariesinstead (see the next section).1-\nFirst, go to thedownload\npageand select the file to download at the top of the page\n(under>>\nBinaries for officially supported Linux platforms (Installation\nWizard):)\naccording to your Linux distribution.2- Once downloaded,\nopen a Linux terminal/console and go where this file is (using thecdcommand).3- Extract the file\nusing the following command: (adapt the following command lines to\nyour case)tar\n-xvf InstallWizard_7.4.0_Ubuntu_13.10_64bit.tar.gz4- Go inside the\nextracted folder and launch therunInstallfile:cd\nInstallWizard_7.4.0_Ubuntu_13.10_64bit./runInstallNB:If you get the error:bash: ./SOME_FILE: Permission denied, make this file executable by typing:chmod +x./SOME_FILEand try again.5- The Install\nWizard appears. Click onNext, letting the default setup. At a\ncertain point, it can be necessary to select a \"installation platform\".\nIn this case, select the only one which is available and go on.Click onStartand wait for the end of the installation process.At the end, you can\nmaybe see an error message saying some libraries are absent. This does not\nmean that Salome won't work properly. You can note somewhere the name\nof these libraries in case you really need them in the future, then\nclose the error message.Click onNextandFinish.6- To launch\nSalome, go inside the Salome folder:cd\n~/salome_7.4.0source theenv_product.shfile:source\nenv_products.shand execute therunSalomecommand:runSalome7- To speed up the launch of Salome, the user can\ncreate a custom script. There are many ways to do it. Here is one\npossibility:a) Create abinfolder in the home\ndirectory:mkdir\n~/binb) Create a script calledsalomeand\nlaunching Salome:echo\n-e '#!/bin/bash\\n. ~/salome_7.4.0/env_products.sh\\nrunSalome $*\\nexit\n0' > ~/bin/salomec) Make it executable:chmod\n+x ~/bin/salomed) Declare that thebinfolder contains\nterminal commands by adding its path to the$PATHvariable in\nthe.bashrcfile which is read each time a new terminal is\nopened:echo\n-e '\\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin/\"' >> ~/.bashrcThen, the user can open a new terminal and launch\nSalome by typing directly:salome2-\nUniversal Binaries ProcessIf the Install Wizard method failed, the user can\ntry to use universal binaries.1- Download it from the thedownload\npage. (under>>\nUniversal binaries for Linux:).2- Once downloaded,\nopen a Linux terminal and go were this file is (using thecdcommand).3- Run the\ndownloaded file:./Salome-V7_4_0-LGPL-x86_64.runNB:If you get the error:bash: ./Salome-V7_4_0-LGPL-x86_64.run: Permission denied, make this file executable by typing:chmod +x./Salome-V7_4_0-LGPL-x86_64.runand try again.4- Let the default\nvalues and press[Enter]until the installation begins.5- To launch Salome, go to the Salome \"appli\" folder:cd\n~/salome/appli_V7_4_0and execute therunApplifile:./runAppli6- To speed up the launch of Salome, you can create an alias in your.bashrcfile:echo -e '\\nalias salome=\"~/salome/appli_V7_4_0/runAppli\"' >> ~/.bashrcThen, the user can open a new terminal and launch\nSalome by typing directly:salome",

The old file are lost and so all the variables (like CASROOT) related to the CAS environment. The CAS variables are not written in the new env files because the wizard has installed only netgen.\nSo when I repeat the installation of netgen it fails because the env variables are not complete and the wizard is not able to find the include files that are needed by netgen.

                "HelloAfter having update the netgen4.5.sh file I have rebuilt all using the install wizard and all was ok.I have installed only the prerequisite packages and I have deselected the Salome  modules  because I wanted to build them with build.csh.So after the rinInstall I have performed also a run of build.csh.All the Salome modules were compiled correctly with the exception of NETGENPLUGIN which failed to build the configure script.In the build_configure_NETGENPLUGIN.log there is the following error:Creating new file 'configure.in' ... doneCreating 'configure' script ...  aclocal: couldn't open directory `/home/walter/local/Salome/salome_3.2.2/SMESH_BUILD/adm_local/unix/config_files': No such file or directoryBut this directory is present in my installation so I do not understand the message.I think that the missing of the NETGENPLUGIN is not very important to me because I need to generate only 2D meshes with mephisto.To test the installation I have run salome and I have bulit a simple cube in the geo module. Then I have swithed to the mesh module but I was not able to generate the 2D mesh. After having selected the 2D hypotesis I have pressed the 'compute' buttom but nothing happened.In the install wizard I have noticed a warning message (during the make of SMESH) that complained the missing of a SMESH lib (now I do not remember which one but I have checked that it was present in the directory SMESH_BUILD/lib/salome). The message was also saying to define the load path trough  -RPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  So I suspect that salome is not able to generate the mesh because I do not have completed this task. May you please give me a list of directories (such as MODULE_ROOT_DIR/....)  that have to add to my  LD_LIBRARY_PATH. At the moment I have defined only the various MODULE_ROOT_DIRs (like SMESH_ROOT_DIR=${INSTALL_ROOT}/SMESH_BUILD).ThanksWalter",

To solve the first problem I have made a dynamic link of f77 with ifort(I have the INTEL fortran compiler).

                "Dear All,I have found the Salome 7.4 binary packages to be awesome and really easy to install.Nevertheless seldomly I come across some glitches in the software which really hamper my progress. I would be willing to invest some time for looking for a solution of these, but in order to do so, I need to use the source-code version of the code in its compiled version.The best version for testing obviously would be the development release as found in the git-repository.Downloading the different files is no problem at all. As a matter of fact, I made a small bash-script for that purpose, which I attach to this thread.My problem indeed is building the whole thing!From some posts I read there was a change to cmake. Unfortunately further information as well as configuration files seem to be missing or faulty for the version pulled from the git-repository.The install-Wizard pulled from the git-repository requests paths that are completely different from what one would have in a git-cloned directory...Therefore my questions are:- Did I just miss the real mother lode of information for configuration and compilation? If so, where can I find that?- Where can I find configuration files which should work with the git-release?- What is the usual procedure to compile the different modules?- Is there a full compilation-script which one could adapt to ones needs (i.e. recompilation of single modules)?Thank you for any constructive answers (even partial ones!) already in advance!Best Regards,Bernhard",

This provides better performance, but the counterpart is that is does not work on old graphic cards or with ssh remote display.An alternative is to build mesa with llvm and gallium to get software rendering with good performance.You have to build llvm and mesa with the right options to get a libGL.so that will be used by Salome at runtime. There is no need to rebuild Salome.With this software rendering enabled, remote display with ssh works but is very slow. Using an accelerated remote desktop server/viewer like x2go, turbovnc or tigervnc gives good performance.You can find attached the insctructions to build and use mesa.

I suppose that surfaces are also of this kind. Hence very dense mesh is generated, that takes very long time.I suggest the following approach. Since your geometry is prismatic, you can mesh only base face of the prism and then extrude Extrude your 2D mesh into a 3D prismatic mesh.Else you can re-create your prism in Geometry module in order to get vertical edges really straight.Here is an extruded mesh. 2D mesh was made using Netgen 2D and Wire Discretization + Adaptive hyp.St.Michael",

Here is the complete procedure that I follow: (a) I convert a sketch to svg using Inkskape, (b) then I extrude 2D geometry in FreeCAD and save it as step file, (c) I import this step file in Salome to first create geometry groups (inlet, outlet, walls), then generate mesh and mesh groups using geometry faces.So if I do not extrude my geometry in FreeCAD and import it as 2D object in Salome and generate first a 2D mesh (as I understood from your suggestion) then (1) how to extrude 2D mesh into a 3D prismatic mesh? (2) how to create mesh groups on geometry (like inlet, outlet, walls for OpenFOAM)?ThanksAsif",

(2) how to create \nmesh groups on geometry (like inlet, outlet, walls for OpenFOAM)?(1) UseModification > Extrusioncommand, with \"Generate groups\" activated. But before create groups following (2).(2) First, create \"inlet, outlet, walls\" groups of geom edges and a group of the sole face (call it \"base\"), then create mesh groups (Create Groups from Geometry) on this geom groups. Extrusion will create all needed groups of faces, you only need toMesh > Union groupsof \"walls_extruded\" + \"base\" + \"base_top\" => \"walls\".BTW I found the reason why NETGEN 1D2D3D hangs up. There is a zero area face in your geometry. To remove it applyRepair > Shape Processing: FixFaceSize (tol=1e-5) + DropSmallEdges (tol=1e-5). After that NETGEN 1D2D3D meshes it easy:St.Michael",

No more system packages, i removed them.But i don't find the option to disable MPI in MED3.Now the configure gets to the end. By the way I use CMAKE now.But the compilation fails on MEDLoader,unknown type MPI_Infounknown type MPI_Commin MED3 med_proto.hI'm quite sure i have a problem in my configuration about MPI, but there may be an error in med_proto.h.MPI structures are used :#ifdef MED_HAVE_MPIMEDparFileOpen(const char* const filename,const med_access_mode accessmode,const MPI_Comm comm, const MPI_Info info);#endifBut it misses the header inclusion for MPI, doesn' it ?",

The classical use case is to build medfile in parallel mode depending on a hdf5 also in parallel compiled with the same MPI product.If you do that, on configure of MED with MPI you should have with cmake the following message :\"hdf5 is parallel\"In this case MPI_INCLUDE_DIRS is automatically added to the HDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS. And all should be OK.I encourage you to synchronize options between hdf5 and medfile.If you are in a hurry, or you do not want to rebuild all (even if it is fast), you can manually add in src/MEDLoader/CMakeLists.txt ${MPI_INCLUDE_DIRS} in INCLUDE_DIRECTORY and ${MPI_DEFINITIONS} in COMPILE_FLAGS as in src/ParaMEDMEM/CMakeLists.txt ..."

                "Dear all,I recently installed Salomé 7.3.0 on our HPC cluster (InstallWizard CentOS 5.5 64bits). It works fine but MED and HDF5 static libraries: libmed.a and libhdf5.a, respectively, are missing.We need those libraries, and the static ones especially, in order to use MED meshes in EDF&L2EP's Code_Carmel3D code.These libraries could be found in Salomé 7.2.0 (same flavour).Is it a voluntary act or a configuration/compilation problem ?Thanks anyway.",
                "Hello,With SALOME 7.3.0 we build hdf5 and med using \nCMake-based build procedure, while for previous versions we used build \nprocedure based on GNU auto-tools (automake/autoconf). As SALOME build \nprocedure is now based on CMake we have found more reasonable to use CMake-based build procedures in other pre-requisites where it is possible.Static libraries are not built by default by CMake-based build procedure.While in med 3.0.7 there's a configuration option -DMEDILE_BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON that allows buiding in the same time both shared and static libraries, there is no such possibility in hdf5 1.8.10If you need static libraries of hdf5 and med you will have to re-build these products yourself.Regards,Vadim.",

From your initial message I see that the problem does not have any relation with missing static libraries of med or hdf5 (as explained in the initial post in this discussion); you seem to have another problem.How did you install SALOME - using Install WIzard or universal binaries?Please provide log or snapshot with the error message.Thank you in advance.Regards,Vadim.",

                "Hello Ashwin,Well, now I see that the problem is somewhere in the installation script. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand where the problem in script exactly as the line number (118) seems to be wrong (due to the way the script is running from Install Wizard, the actual line number differs from what is printed).Since this problem was not detected during testing on different platforms I suppose it is related somehow to the configuration of your shell interpeter. The scripts from Install Wizard are executed using bash. However, on some platforms bash can be configured to link to sh, dash or other interpeter.Can you provide an output of the following command?ls -la /bin/bashAnd, by the way, what is your Linux platform?Regards,Vadim.",

                "Hi,I am a new user to Salome. First of all, I thank the developers for such a wonderful open source platform.I have installed and tested Salome on Windows (64 bit) and Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 64- bit) and it works great, though it took some time to learn the basics. I have developed a Monte Carlo based code, for which I need to create geometries and mesh them. The problem with Salome is, it is too bloated for my purpose. All I need is a simple CAD application which develops simple geometries, like cylindrical or rectangular cavities, and a simple module for meshing these geometries. We already have our own visualization module which is integrated to MC code.So, I would like to build 2 standalone components, Geometry and mesh, and remove all the other modules (YACS, Paraview). I would like to build these on windows platform first.I am not aware of software development as I am from thermal and heat transfer domain.I request anyone over here to provide me help as to how I should start with.Thanks.SaiP.S. : Apologies, if you find my English poor.",
                "Hi SaiSALOME modules are loaded in memory at the user request, except some resources. You can limit a number of available modules e.g. by specifying needed modules as an option of runSalome command like thisrunSalome -m GEOM,SMESHIt would be nice if one could easy use SALOME modules w/o all that CORBA envelope. But this is impossible w/o some knowledge in software development.St.Michael",
                "Thanks Micheal,Two doubts regarding the same.1) Is the command suggested applicable to both Windows and linux?2) As per what I understand, that the CORBA interface helps in communication of various Salome modules. And yes, as you have mentioned, I do want to eliminate this link. I have few friends of mine who are into software development and I can easily take their help.As I see on the download page, sources for building Salome have been provided. If I tell my friend to just download the same and build GUI for selected modules removing the CORBA interface source code.  Does that work, or , am I over simplifying the the whole build procedure?Thanks.Sai",
                "1) I suppose that on Windows that command is invoked by some .bat file that you could modify for your purpose.2) SALOME GUI communicates with the modules via CORBA. Hence as you cut off CORBA, you have no GUI.SALOME uses OpenCascade Technology (OCCT) as a CAD kernel. OCCT has 'DRAW' test harness that you could use to create your simple geometry in batch mode. Alternatively, there are some open source CAD programs built over OCCT that you can find in WWW, even probably SALOME w/o CORBA.If you plan to generate tetrahedral meshes, you can use NETGEN also available as a standalone program, to mesh geometries made using OCCT.St.Michael"

One of the main requirements is to be able to run the whole application on Windows, and unfortunately it seems to be a rather big technical obstacle right now.So my main question ishow to build the whole SALOME on Windows from Git repository(latest version) and run it? Are there any instructions already written/published?And I'd like to discuss: is SALOME platform on Windows ready for production use? How many people develop and support the Windows variant? Can I hope that if bugs and issues are discovered someone would help to fix it?Is it possible to compile 64-bit version of SALOME on Windows? Is it possible to integrate 64-bit components into 32-bit SALOME?Currently I'm studying SALOME 5.1.4 for tests on Windows.Best regards,Andrew",
                "Hello,We tested SALOME on Windows at our company this summer. Some trainee engineers were our beta-testers.SALOME Windows is almost ready for daily use. The manipulations on the 3D view are almost as fast as on Linux, and much comfortable than with Salome on Linux through NX.The only bug compared to the Linux version is not to be able to select sub-shapes in the 3D view to explode or to create a geom group. It's not a problem if you're working with parametric studies by scripting the construction of the shape in python, which is highly recommended if you work on complex shapes.The 2 Go 32bit-limit was reached in the middle of the project, so they had to use Salome on Linux 64 bits. The study worked well on Linux without any change in the python script but the working path to save the mesh.Concerning the GIT repository, it has barely changed since V5.1.5 release. The last modification was on december 1st. I wanted to provide nightly builds on linux from this repository, but I don't know if it's worth the while since new bug fixes seem to be only commited to the V6 branch.Christophe",

USB support disabled for now\" when running xdriver without root permissions; and \"USB\" item is not even shown in the setup window.2) As soon as installation of the driver has been completed, and Space Mouse has been connected to USB port, I was able to use it with SALOME.This means that I managed to move mouse cursor with Space Mouse over the screen and perform other actions:- rotate (button 1);- pan (button 2);- zoom (button 3).This all works in:- ParaView viewer;- OCC and VTK viewers if \"navigation mode\" is set to \"keyboard-free\".Note: if \"navigation mode\" is set to \"standard\" in OCC and VTK viewers, button 1 performs selection, button 3 invokes popup menu.In other words, standard driver behavior is to translate space mouse events as follows:- button 1 to the left mouse button click event- button 2 to the middle mouse button click event- button 3 to the right mouse button click eventRegards,Vadim.",

                "Hello Michele,Indeed, the way the SALOME platform is installed is different between SALOME Installation Wizard and universal binaries (Salome-Meca is based on lattter one). The problem you experience seems to be related to the environment.I would recommend you to change a way you run SALOME. Instead of sourcing env_products.sh in your .bashrc file (and, thus, spoiling your environment by products coming with SALOME), you can create a shell script to run SALOME, e.g.cat > mySalome.sh <<EOF#!/bin/bash. /home/michele/salome7.4.0/env_product.shrunSalomeEOFchmod +x mySalome.shAlso, you can use alternative way to start SALOME: as you installed SALOME 7.4.0 using Installation Wizard, you should be able to find salome_appli_7.4.0 folder in your target directory:  /home/michele/salome7.4.0/salome_appli_7.4.0. You can run SALOME by typing:/home/michele/salome7.4.0/salome_appli_7.4.0/salomeor/home/michele/salome7.4.0/salome_appli_7.4.0/runAppliRegards,Vadim."

Looked in the samples folder mind you and there where no example data in them, so left it for the night.Then waking up today I noticed I cannot see an Icon for Salome anywhere to start learning, testing and find some tutorials and data to work with to start learning.I orginally installedhttp://www.caelinux.com/CMS/to make life easier as I am very Linux rusty. It ran but it did not work with important elements of my hardware hence having to find a newer Distrobution. I am on a Lenovo Ideapad Y510P, Intel and Nvidia Graphics, i7 Core. Hence installing Xubuntu, using the Xfe windows manager as per the CAE Linux Distro, thinking this would make more sense.I also tried to installhttp://www.ros.org/but that seemed to have tons of problems with the repositry. I think dependancies out side of repositries my system has reference too, so I will get onto their discussion board shortly. Likewise with OpenFoam. I am rather frustrated I hoped linux and operating systems would have come along a bit more than this by now. In fact technology in general, what prompted me to try and put my science hat on again.Id like to investigate some novel robotics and A.I, inspired byhttp://www.openworm.org/and Open Source Brain. Having had an interest in A.I as soon as I had the first home computers the ZX81, then Texas Instruments T99-4A, then C64, went on to study Engineering Mechatronics, Software Engineering but ended up in the High End Technology Field of TV, Film and Broadcasting Visual FX, Animation and Post-Production Systems. I even studied some Neurology via the Open University here in the UK and did my own personal research into novel EEG technology way back too.My interest is within a new paradigm in soft Robotics, Electronics, Soft computing, as in physically soft. Based around dielectric elastomershttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_elastomersand if Elastomers can be used to create semiconductors more like Nurons.

I just installed Fedora core 5 on my conputer.Now I would like to install Salome but even after reading the doc I am not really sure about the appropriate way to proceede.May be somebody could help me if it is not too much trouble ?Thank a lot in advanceMichel",
                "Hello Michel,To install SALOME just cd to the SALOME Install Wizard root directory and typerunInstall. It will launch SALOME Installation Wizard in GUI mode. It will guide you through all installation steps. In general case you well just need to enter target installation directory path. By default it is the user's home directory.Please, take into account that Linux Fedora Core 5 is not included in the list of platforms for which SALOME platform is tested, so the default installation configuration (config.xml) file will be used by the Installation Wizard. This also means that the precompiled binaries for the default platform will be installed (Mandrake 10.1).This may cause compatibility problems.If you have some troubles with the default installation settings you can try to use another XML configuration files (which can be found in the Installation Wizard's root directory). To do this use -f  parameter of the runInstall script, for example:>> runInstall -f config_Mandriva_2006.0.xmlIn general case you need to install all products from precompiled binaries (install binaresoption). This is the quickest way to install SALOME platform. But if this does not work you always may chooseinstall sourcesoption for all the products and in this case all the products will be built from sources on your coumputer. However it will take some time (up to 24 hours).Regards,Vadim.",
                "Hello Vadim,Thank you very much for your answer.I checked that there are a lot of prerequisites that are already installed, exactly 13 out of 19.All preinstalled prerequisites are newer versions than the ones proposed by default.Is it possible to keep all of them and in that case what should I do ?I was thinking about using Installation Wizard GUI, keep all the preinstalled softwars as native and rebuild the other prerequisites from source files, using the config xml file proposed for Redhat8.0 version. Is this approach correct?But I noticed that only two preinstalled prerequistes (gcc and Tcltk) are viewed by the Installation Wizard.Please keep in mind that I am really new to Linux and that I am trying very hard to understand something ...ThanksMichel",
                "Hello Michel,SALOME is compiled on the predefined set of pre-requisite products. More newer versions of products can be used but with care, because they are not checked. This is what I mentioned as compatibility problem.The SALOME Installation Wizard can not automatically detect all native products. It is possible to built all pre-requisites manually from scratch but this is not easy procedure and requires some  experience in Linux.I suppose that the best way for you is not trying using native products but installing those versions of products provided by the SALOME Installation Wizard.Regards,Vadim.",

Michel",
                "Hello Michel,You're right, there is a problem with CASCADE on your Fedora 5 station. Open CASCADE libraries were not built and tested on this platform.But in order to analyze the problem in more detail can  you do the following:- go to your KERNEL_BUILD directory- open config.log file- search there \"checking for OpenCascade libraries\" line in this file.In the text fragment below this line you can find the information why configure script failed to link to CASCADE libraries. Probably there is just lack of some libraries on your computer which are required by CASCADE. Or it can be some another reason.Attach please the text fragment from config.log for me to take a look also.Regards,Vadim.",

Here are some suggestions that might help you.1. Save as often as you can between GUI operations.  As often as you are willing to tolerate!2. Save the study and open a new session of Salome (after doing a shutdown of CORBA (?) servers, before testing or starting on complex operations.3. If you believe you have a large size model, then check that you have a cleanly re-booted PC to ensure that Salome will not go into memory swapping, because if you are low on free RAM, it seems that even moderate amounts of memory swapping causes Salome to malfunction.  Perhaps it has something to do with inter-process communication and timing.  In fact I have seen it function contrary to the python script I have programmed it to follow.  The same script works fine when using a clean Salome (or sometimes even needing a clean OS reboot).4.

Finally, hope that somebody will fix the problemsThese have been my observations over several weeks even on the latest version 5.1.4.  Let us know how it goes...Regards,JMBHello Cacciatorino,Let me add a couple of hints:7) Since version 5.1.3 there's an auto-save function in SALOME GUI. This option is activated via \"Preferences\" dialog box, \"SALOME\" page, \"General\" tab.8) If you work with very large studies, switch on \"Multi-file save\" option in Preferences. With this option, the saving operation works more quickly and consumes less RAM resources. The main disadvantage of this approach is that in \"multi-file\" mode SALOME produces several files for each study; you have to remember to copy all these files if you plan to distribute your studies.Regards,Vadim.",

Maybe the Python 2.5 was updated to 2.6.Could you solve the problem? Which Python version are you using? How is it possible to go back to Python 2.5? The update manager won't let me delete the Python 2.6. If I install the Python 2.6 parallel I need to know how to direct Salome to the Python 2.5.Thanks a lot, Klaus",
